       "'This was my first and only purchase so far but I\\'ll return. Terrific deal on Cuisinart knives!\\nThe Clothes is really great quality , though a bit pricey.\\nEasy purchase, professional staff\\nThe reason for 5 stars is the quality of their research, and dedication of their physicians and staff. \\n I had been told the reality of my situation,from the beginning,  that for me at 69yrs old, runner, I would have 30% chance of Regenexx  to work for my RIght hip. I try to practice as much hope as possible and went for the 30...  I did end up getting a right hip rreplacement,  the 6 month evaluation, showed the hip worsening.  I also used Regenexx clinic for my back problems and it helped 100%...and my right ankle..which helped 90%.\\n  I can\\'t say enough about their honesty and dedication, and am truly grateful, I went there first before i had the replacement or else I wouldn\\'t be as peaceful about my situation which I did NOT want to do!!!\\nThe shirts I bought are awesome yhe material is good quality and the designs were fun. That being said... 25$ a shirt on average was pretty steep. However, I wasn\\'t going to get the designs I got anywhere else so it was overall well worth it.\\nThe website has helped me to earn bitcoins easily. The options to earn money is more compared to other websites. One of the best sites to earn btc for sure.\\nThe customer service agent who helped me was fantastic. She was lovely to speak with and had a great personality. They should hire more people like her and give here a raise! It was a pleasure to make my reservation and people like her will make me use the 7\\'s again.\\nIt was easy to place the order.  It was shipped in a timely fashion.\\nDid a great and fixed the problem   thank you so much  Lois Morris\\nI was so thankful to find Urbangirl and all the great Kate Spade office supplies on her site.  Her website was easy to navigate through and I found everything I was looking for.  I was impressed with the fast shipping and how well my items were packages.  I was especially drawn to the sweet hand-written note from the seller!  I will purchase from this company again!\\nThis is the third time we have rented through AVR.  They have the lowest prices and quality vans.  We had a problem one time but they were quick to correct it. I would recommend them to anyone.\\nGot it unlocked the next day and updated my iPhone to iOS 6.0.1. I didn\\'t have to jail break it or anything. Thanks guys!!  =)\\nSuper easy and love the discounts!\\nQuick reliable friendly.\\nMy dad has been using Bay Alarm for about 5 months. In error he set it off once and an operator called him within 20 second, they asked if he needed assistance.\\r\\nThe system was easy to set-up by using the existing jack from his computer.\\r\\nHopefully he\\'ll never have to use it for an emergency but it gives my sister and I piece of mind.\\nSuch an easy experience! found a great trip at a great price!\\nOne of the best online booking experiences I\\'ve had yet. Thanks!\\nExcellent function and very experienced installation personal.\\nHello Fresh has made my life easy. I never have to worry about going to the grocery store after work or trying to figure out what to cook for dinner. The ingredients they send have always been very fresh and the meals have always been wonderful tasting.\\nFor us the best place to leave car. From the workers that check in car, front desk & especially the bros that drive shuttle God bless you guys for an incredible staff. Every time I fly anywhere I park there. Never again to bother anyone to drive me to airport & pick me up. Parking there at the Radisson never a problem,  much respect. \\n\\nAgain 5 stars for this service Im most defiantly sure the stay at this hotel is awesome as well.\\nBless you all\\nWilson & Carmen Lopez Staten Island NY\\nBought tickets to the Celtics game the other night , and plan on buying Red Sox tickets real soon\\nEasy navigation and great communication,\\nLoved my new drive wear glasses!!\\nItem delivered quickly.  Easy to do business with.  Thanks.\\nGOOD App I used this for years and it was good for finding great rates now it\\'s just like the rest of the competition.(Expedia,etc)\\nClothes are good quality, cuts/styles are current, and items ship quickly and without issue. I especially loved Masie Oversized Cowl Tunic Top that I purchased (true to \"size\" - keeping in mind that it will be oversized). Only downside: have to pay for return shipping which would be a huge customer service move if this could change.\\nI love not having to shop around for cat food.  The service is prompt and I like the fact that I can change it to meet my needs or actually the needs of my cats.\\nI was very pleased. Ordered the night before and was delivered by promised. The flowers looked just like what was pictured. The cost was average, the only thing that was a little too high is the delivery charge.\\r\\nBut I would use them again.\\nVery Impressed.  Ordered a plaque for my GF a couple of days after her Ace, we received it in the mail w/in 3 days.  Quick, accurate and professional.\\nIf you pre-order a game there is a chance you will not get any of the pre-order bonus\\'. I was told I didn\\'t pre-order even when I showed proof, that was ignored.\\nAAAAA++++ Instant delivery!\\nI have purchased twice from Pure Romance and so far they have NOT let me down! I really enjoy their products!\\nIt takes awhile to see results, but when the settlements start, it goes quickly.\\nWhen both of the tier 2 tech guys came out today they were real nice and professional. However, I still do not have my internet going and it\\'s getting very fersturating!\\nI\\'ve had a great experience when I went to cash1 everyone was nice and I was able to get the help I needed!\\nThere are a lot of sites that say they are cheap or you can get the cheapest deal but this site is the cheapest by far. They are not only cheap but free shipping and handling. They even pay for your return shipment when times up. This site is amazing i order my school books from here all the time and its what i order.  Plus, it comes fast in the mail and the books are good quality.\\nGreat selection. Good support.\\nFirst, I was treated professionally while ordering. Another highlight for me, and why I will be a return customer, is because the customer service representative searched for and redeemed a coupon code for my purchase. My contacts also arrived earlier than expected. The prescription contacts received were what I ordered and I am a happy customer!\\nI waited 4 weeks for the visa to be put in my passport.  I needed it quickly to apply for another visa needed.\\nI did not receive an e-mail until in was sent.\\nI called directly every week. Last week I was told that it would arrive, Friday, September 2, 2016.  I waited at home all day.\\nI called for the fourth time on Monday, September 5, 2016 and the passport had not been cleared by the agent.  A few hours later I received my first e-mail and it was overnighted Fed-Ex. I received it Tuesday, September 6.  A disappointing experience for the price.\\nUsing remitly is so good and fast my family had the money from USA to Philippines in a few minutes not hours like other companies thank you remitly\\nWas not thrilled with the elimination of the name your price tool. While it was chancy at times I did get some phenomenally great deals. Not sure if what I am reading is true but it appears it was eliminated because the process was too much for an impatient generation. I stll get some good express deals but gone are the days of $50 3 star deals.\\nHad the parts I needed in stock\\nits not easy to use\\nEasy and fast, and the results are beautiful.\\nI sent this as a gift to all of my brothers and sisters across the country and they loved it!\\nNever thought that could be this easy.\\nNever received my order!!!\\nUPS lost our package and Dental Planet took care of it immediately. My package was late but at no fault to them, I would recommend buying from Dental Planet!\\nThe service seems good but can be improved, especially in the case of rebooking fix that as in my regrets not having received your help to quickly locate a new reservation with the correction of an inadvertent error of mine, and that after two days there had myself to track abruptly canceling other initial reservation having no favorable response from Sky, to finish booking again with Sky, after having canceled the initial operation and insist that prices had similar or more favorable than the that was to change, I just proposed a very high overhead to make the change, which was not real.\\nnice price and shipping is so fast\\nI have just done this.....303 is  best and safest relaxing thing out there.  It is expensive at the doctors office.  I can now get it here and have it when my body goes crazy.  it works to relax me with the allergies.\\nEverything went smoothly.\\nI really appreciate the way you sent job alerts, I had many many calls to set up interviews. I did get a job, but it was from a family source, but the company is still hiring. LSG, Sky Chef out by the airport. Good luck with your job searches.\\ni love hobbylinc, they have all my needs and r real easy to order from. i would and regularly suggest hobbylinc, and i intend to keep using them for my future purchases.\\nDo not use this company. Pay the extra money to go with a reputable company. When they ship bad parts, they contest and challenge you from the beginning, and make it hard to get a claim. Not what you want to go through...avoid them at all costs.\\nBest shows ever!\\nThe citypass made it so much easier for my family and I to see many of Toronto\\'s beautiful tourist locations without breaking the bank.\\nWebsites are not cooperative, they ask for details and seemingly never act once the data is input.  Lot of failures to take the information.\\nMatt guided me through the process quickly without any problems.\\nVery good experience. Help requested provided in a timely manner.\\nCost and time of delivery were \"Excellent\".  However, my printer would not accept the ink cartridge.  So it does me no good.  I am out the money and have no ink for my printer.\\nBrandon is an awesome employee he went above and beyond to help my family when we really needed it. He stayed late just to make sure that we were ok and that we had everything we needed to move things into the storage unit. We needed the truck to bring somethings over and he stayed later so that we could unload it and we had to move fast. I just wanted to let anyone know that he is an awesome employee and the units are clean and everything is well taken care of there. If you need a storage unit go see brandon up there!!!Thanks austyn\\nThis was my first time booking thru JustFly.com and I was very satisfied with their service. There were no hidden fees and the price was perfect. Exactly what I was looking for. I will recommend Just Fly to everyone. Great service.\\nBest price I\\'ve found for a Litmann Cardiology IV.  Fast engraving, no errors.  Really fast shipping even using standard shipping.\\nMy loan officer was very helpful through this whole process\\nI will never order my supplements from anyone else.  The process was easy and the service was excellent.\\nLike the shirt but do fee it looks small.  Child is just a 3T and I ordered a 4 and it really is small.  Hope it does shrink in the wash.\\nI\\'d appreciate apply my credits to purchases under the credit amount of 49.95 \\n\\nReally cute clothes! Clothes are true to size\\nGreat servis. Easy to get your car\\nI opt for PRINCE 2 Online Classroom Flexi-Pass course & found to be very convenient and helpful. Trainers were very well experienced in sharing & teaching with real time examples which was really helpful to understand at beginner level. The very special thing from this organisation is providing the class recording which really helps to enhance & understand the topics at later stages. Also the trainers are providing the special notes prepared during the online class. Overall experience was great & awesome..\\nIt was a true value.  We reserved business class and got first class.\\nAs much money I have spent with popcornopolis I could not believe how my orders were not what I requested, and after contacting customer service I did not receive much help. Make me not even want to buy from you anymore.\\nGot a $5.00 credit after spending over $2000 my first month. I was going to continue to do business with them but probably ends after receiving my last order/shipment. I got a KD Signed Basketball that had a smeared autograph. I was corrected and they said it was \"Smudged\" lol. I said, why wasn\\'t it in the description? The reply, well it shows in the picture. I was bidding on like 4 other basketballs and could\\'ve paid a little more for the same thing without the \"Smudge!\" I DIDN\\'T ask for a refund or return. I asked for a credit since I would be ordering a lot of items to finish my man-cave, give out gifts, and trades with my collector friends. But hey, I guess, my business means nothing to them...Or, maybe $5 bucks! Hope you guys hire a real manager in your customer service department that thinks long haul for repeat customers.\\nI’m happy that I am on my way to a life free of debt.\\nI was really impressed with the products that are offered in the catalog and even more on the website. I was able to buy christmas gifts for family using the credit that was offered that I couldn\\'t afford all at once otherwise. I also got free shipping and 25 off $100 and that really saved the day! I am excited to see the products and the looks on family\\'s faces. I would have spent even more if I had more credit. I will definitely keep using this credit for gifts and a little something for myself in the future.\\nI was nervous going in. I don\\'t like salesman who push. That\\'s not what happened here. Everyone was pleasant. Kevin, the young man who actually put my new tires on, was very polite.\\nI purchased the product and works great and I would recommend to others\\nI went to other places and they were the only ones that would finance me and so far they have done me right so I would recommend them to anyone\\nExcellent service and very professional\\nThe cervis was wanterfu\\nI bought an ac compressor for my 2006 pontiac g6.  It said 2-4 days for shipping.  I waited almost 2 weeks, opened the box and it looked sketchy, it was brown amd rusted a little bit.   I googled the part and it said it was for a 2006 chevy malibu. I thought well maybe this is just another part thats the same (some parts are the same kind as the malibu) so i had my mechanic put the part in. THE PART DID NOT WORK!!!!!   I am currently waiting to return it because they arent open on weekends.  Lets hope they stick to what they advertise and i get my $200 back...\\nIf you want a review, have the courtesy to call me by my name\\nAs an artist and collector, I have both sold and purchased artwork through Saatchi Art, having bought three works of art over the past year or so from artists in Europe and Asia, shipping to destinations in the U.S. and Turkey.  Each of these purchases were excellently brokered and the artwork arrived professionally packaged and carefully presented with the artwork meeting or exceeding my expectations based upon the photo(s) as seen on the website.\\r\\n\\r\\nInternational shipping (especially to or from non-western countries) can sometimes pose moments of frustration, but this is to be expected and in the cases where I had trouble getting my artwork into or out of Turkey, the representatives at Saatchi Art were very fast to respond and diligent in getting the work to its destination in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nI would absolutely recommend Saatchi Art for both experienced and new collectors, adding that it is the best international platform for artists in the earlier stages of their careers and so, because of this, artists are very careful to conduct themselves most professionally when working with Saatchi so as to maintain good relationships with them.  So you can expect that in general artists will represent their work accurately on the website, prepare and ship their work carefully, and sincerely anticipate the buyer will love the work as much as he or she hoped in that moment when the package is finally opened and the artwork first seen by its new owner.\\nWhen we arrived at the hotel to check in with my booking voucher we had to wait nearly an hour whilst the booking was checked and confirmed as Amona had failed to notify the hotel of the booking! The hotel was very apologetic however I was left frustrated and annoyed thinking that I had been scammed and it wasted nearly an hour of our weekend sorting out an administration error.\\nGREAT SERVICE HOPE TO USE AGAIN.\\nThe whole process is so easy.  Timely shipping and good prices!\\nVery easy to navigate the website. Video explanation of the products I purchased were very helpful.\\nThey we\\'re on time.

Thank you very much.\\nQuick turn around and had what I wanted\\nThey had exactly what I wanted and needed, I was so surprised when my order arrived within a couple of days, Great service! Their prices are very reasonable compared to other sites.  My only problem was with a folding reacher/grabber.  When open it is very wobbly where it folds, but that is the manufacturer\\'s fault.  I am very pleased with this company and will definitely order again!\\nCame in as expected, in just three days out of the seven, although the box of my purchase aka the cover, the corners were bent, and i like my corners a full 90 degrees.\\nAwesome service, I placed my order on Sunday and received the item in Canada by Wednesday. I highly recommend Planet Express for forwarding service.\\nNeeded to get it sent really quick,to help my loved on phillipines,called customer service few minutes later she had it\\nIt was ok nothing was really nasty seen no bugs but needs upgraded..bed was old and really soft...coffee pot was nasty still had coffee in it from ppl before is.

I never had any issues. I was very satisfied with the services rendered to me.\\nI have enjoyed the ease of using this security system. I\\'ve had no problems whatsoever.\\nBoth sets of clubs showed up in Tucson on time! The clubs were shipped back from Scottsdale and arrived on time also! I have and will continue to use Ship Sticks when we travel. Great job once again!!!\\nHad a great experience. No problems, gave me the price quoted and mailed the check out quickly. Thank you!\\nI had an order get canceled but did NOT get an email telling me that it was canceled.  After I called, I understand why it was canceled and the lady I talked to was very nice, but it would be better if I got an email quicker telling me about it.\\nI was skepitcal at first because it was such a good price and thought it was to good to be true!! I placed my order on a Saturday and had it by thursday. I would definitely buy from them again!!!\\nHaven\\'t heard anything for three weeks since my order, then I get this email to review my experience with ielectrica, so I\\'m going to call today.\\nWell I called, and it\\'s on back order but they don\\'t know when they\\'ll be getting them in.  Would\\'ve been nice to know before ordering from them since this was for Christmas and I ordered back in November.  But they seemed easy enough to deal with over the phone so I\\'ll give it another week or so before canceling.\\nThey have great prices, but the bottom line is don\\'t order unless you don\\'t care if it comes in a few months down the road.\\nWide range of products.  Always have found what I needed.  The website is easy to use.  I received the product quickly, and was packaged well (breakable.)  My only complaint is that the company sends coupons that expire quickly.  That means that I\\'ve never been able to use the coupons.  If I need something in a month, I order it all at the same time.  Wish the coupons were good for [perhaps] three months.\\nEasy ordering, quick delivery of product.  I would consider it \"flawless\" service!\\nVery easy transaction, quote was Flawless and quick, I was able to save a great deal of money on my insurance with higher limits and better coverage over my previous insurer.\\nI didn\\'t like that the offer of free shipping was rendered null and void because the items were on sale.  i would have saved more had they been regular price and I could have the free shipping.  I felt that this was done on purpose.\\nThe site is easy, but I am new to searching for jobs again, and I just need help on great wording better the results.\\nAbsolutely great. Very fast and straight to the point of what I needed. Would definitely recommend this site!\\nGreat driver. Ok car. A little pricey.\\nI was sent unbranded generic toner cartridges instead of the ones I\\'d ordered -- and I wasn\\'t even sent all of those. The company has not responded to emails or phone calls -- or to complaints to the better business bureau and to my credit card company. I\\'m now out $500 because I will not use mystery cartridges in an expensive printer.\\nMy second order from Motomummy and both times items were high quality and shipped fast!\\nPrompt shipment. Fair price. Will buy again.\\nI am very pleased with the service I received today.  My computer was not working at all due to a Trojan.  It\\'s fine now.  What a lifesaver!\\nthe best place to get cheep games\\nsqueaky ball was a bit dirty, but other then that everything was great.\\nGreat product, great price, received immediately.  Will use them again to order our Lymphedema Products.\\nI was able to quickly order my license plate bracket in the user-friendly shopping cart on the partsgeek website. My item arrived very quickly, with no issues or damage. The bracket fit my truck perfectly, the only downside was that it didn\\'t come with mounting hardware (which I should have checked for before ordering). It was easy to mount on my front bumper in the spot designed into the truck for it. Overall, this was a quick, painless transaction that I am very happy with.\\nI ordered 12 used books.  The price was good for these books which were all the same.  They only had some in good and some in fair condition.   I was disappointed that two of the books had broken bindings.  Otherwise the rest of the books were good and arrived before the stated arrival date.\\nI am in love with the product and  the purchasing experience! Thank you!\\neverything worked out fine, its a smart system, but they charge more than i expected for the service\\nGreat Help and Fast.\\nNever a problem with my orders - packed very well.\\nSuper simple and easy process to book a flight!\\nHad issues that their standard list would not accommodate, and we asked them to make special changes, which they did without issue (or even additional charge other than they had previously quoted!) so when we got our order it was exactly as we wished.  I would highly recommend them to anyone.\\nThis was a very easy process and the agents that called me were very helpful and pleasant to talk to\\nI\\'ll let you know how I feel once my order arrives.....\\nCompassion ate and even more on time!!!\\nMy experience with budget dumpster was mostly positive. The only thing I didn\\'t like was having to wait last minute for drop off. They where fast on pick up so big thumps up for that,  I would recommend .\\nFast shipping and friendly customer service when I called to inquire about my order.  In regards to the sink protectors sitting too high off the bottom of the sink I took the rubber plastic feet off and they sat in the sink with just enough clearance to make it easy to rinse the sink of food waste and fits my sinks perfectly.  Without the rubber feet in place the metal leaves a sort of dark mark on the stainless but you can\\'t see it with the protector in place and the mark can be removed with a little Bar Keeper\\'s Friend if you end up removing the protector.  I wish I had bought these sooner!  It was a great purchase!\\nShipping is too high. But your items get to you quickly and overall it\\'s a good company. You should have promo for loyal customers.\\nTIMELY DEPENDABLE SERVICE, WITH PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS.\\nRyan was extremely confident and assisted us with helping make the right decisions for our business needs.\\nAptly named!

Thanks Mom and Dad Speedy Cash!\\nGreat program\\nEven though the prices are abit expensive than other sites, it still is a trustworthy site i would recommend\\nMy mom is in the hospital and I can always count on Remitly to send money to pay for her hospital bills. So easy and trusted company. Moneygram and western union sucks. They don\\'t want to accept my online transfer eventhough my mom is fighting for her life. Solid Remitly customer.\\nI\\'ve been using Topcashback for years. It\\'s solid and reliable.\\nProduct was installed well but there are limits on where installers can go. For example cannot go in attic to make connections. I had to do this myself. Product operating very well with no drop in service over one year. Contract does not allow for vacation mode if gone for extended period of time. My ISP in another town provides this flexibility with appropriate limits.\\nThe best my mummy love it\\nLabels arrived right on time and were exactly as shown. Will definitly be ordering again. Thanks!\\nbest place to find items usually at prices better than you may find on ebay\\nMy car was picked up and arrived on time as promised with no damage. Excellent service and so happy I chose this company out of the many out there.\\nTrustedHousesitters.com is an excellent idea! After much effort to find someone who could take care of our dogs while we should be abroad - without result - a friend made us aware of TrustedHousesitters. We signed up as homeowners only 2-3 weeks before we were going on vacation. Time passed and we received no answers. Our holiday was very close, and we had almost given up to travel. Then TrustedHousesitters let us out as a matter of urgency, and it gave results. A great couple from England offered to help us, and we ended up leaving our home and dogs, feeling safe while our English friends took care of both the house, the garden and our three dogs. Thanks for a great initiative! We recommend TrustedHousesitters to our friends!\\nThe sevice was excellent, I would recommend it to my family and friends.\\nWell done keep up the Good service!\\nMy experience with thrift books has been good. The only thing that can be improved on is the shipping of items. They offer free shipping on $10 or more orders and that\\'s great because the prices of the items are very reasonable.  I think if the items are shipped and received with a turn around time of two days it would be even greater. But I will continue to return. I\\'ve mentioned this website to other friends. \\n\\nHonest Maddy\\nA great experience! Dedicated to resolving the problem!\\nExcellent and outstanding experience with my agent\\nI like to order in Jomashop because of best price and best quality.\\nThe purchases I have made are great and delivery times are excellent . I will definitely shop here in the future .\\nVery unhappy with the deceiving way the Hobbyking website is setout. \\n I purchased an item in good faith paying what was described as \"shipping AND Taxes\".  However i have since been charged a further £28 taxes.  I appreciate Taxes need to be paid, but DONT say they are included if you then intent to deceive the customer and not include them.  This is very disapointing.  I contacted custoemr support, who \\n said that the \"shipping and Taxes\" ESTIMATOR is only an estimate and that actually it does not inlcude taxes anyway.  On being told thsi is suggested they change the web page to a more honest description but was told that this would loose them sales as it would make them too expensive so they would therefore not be doing that.  \\n\\nAs a busines they have lied and deceived me as a customer, they have quoted something that is \"included\" and have not followed through with your written contract.  You can be assured that i will not purchase from them again following this disastrous lack of support\\nThriftbooks is a really wonderful idea, well-executed. There are few books that I haven\\'t been able to locate on there and the price is always good.\\nI did have to call for more info on the mobile unit as the print on the instructions was extremely small even for my daughter to read, and all the pictures were black (I assume because the unit is black) but extremely difficult to understand because of black on black.  I would suggest the instructions be put in color to make the different parts more easily identifiable.  Customer service was very helpful in walking us through the process with the mobile unit.\\nMy driver appears updated.  Thank you.\\nEasy,fair price,had my car washed, quick service.....will use them again!\\nI received everything I ordered faster than anticipated. Everything I received was quality and as advertised. I look forward to ordering more in the near future.\\ni love the products and my consultant is the GREATEST! Staci Hissong is outstanding!\\nProduct was as described and it arrived fast. I couldn\\'t be happier.\\nGreat products and great service\\nIt is a lot of fun and a lot of hard work!\\nVery nice house in quiet neighborhood. Everything was done to a high standard in the house. Our kids loved the air hockey , ping pong and foosball tables in the garage.

Very pleased and would purchase again without hesitation.  Thank you!\\nshirts are the best, and when something doesn\\'t fit perfect, the response is fantastic and replacement for free\\nI found 1-800-DENTIST on an AARP website.  I was looking for info about dentists in my area and their prices.  1-88-DENTIST transferred me immediately to a dentist that wanted to sign me up  immediately for a checkup at a new patient bargain price.  Upon further inquiry I discovered they were the same price as my present dentist.  All I really wanted were names and approximate price lists for dentists in my area not a new dentist ready to sign me up as a patient immediately.  I did not like nor want the pressure.  Won\\'t use this site again nor will recommend it to anyone.\\nOrdered air filter and cabin air filter for Mazda CX5, prices were lowest I could find on the internet and filters were perfect.\\nI have ordered from pureformulas many times and have never had a problem!

I will purchase from here again when need arises.\\nEasy to navigate and to check out!\\nI consider tripadvisor as my first go-to resource when planning vacations.  I love the helpful reviews and member photos.  I often receive helpful tips on which rooms to request or which entrees are not to be missed.  I never hesitate to trust tripadvisor reviews for restaurants although I am beginning to have to exercise more caution when considering accommodation and activity reviews.  If a reviewer has many posts and previous reviews, I will trust them.  But often I am finding that a near-the-top-ranked  hotel or tour company, for example, might have MANY reviews that seem questionable.  The reviewer only has 1 or 2 previous reviews and maybe no (or 1-2) forum posts and says generic things.  If I see too many of this type of review for an establishment, I don\\'t trust their ranking. It makes me question whether or not they are paying people to write reviews for them (I\\'ve read that reviews can be \"bought\").  So, all in all, I still view tripadvisor to be a valuable resource but at time I am suspicious of the authenticity of some of the reviews.\\nGood prices. Good products. Timely delivery. Excellent packaging.\\nThe whole process was went well. I liked the fact that I was emailed about my package movement. I just don\\'t like the fact that it is delivered without my presence. But still I will use and recommend them.\\nJackie was very kind and helpful.\\nFast, Safe, Easy.\\nI can highly recommend it.\\nEasy to use good deals much appreciation\\nChecks are OK but\\n1) Took a long time to get them\\n2) Added logo is overshadowing text... if this was VistaPrint they would have adjusted this.\\n3) Color of checks is not what I expected.\\nI would recommend the company to anyone.\\nEasy to use & many positive experiences.\\nI got what I ordered.

Broker said twice it wasn\\'t possible to close on the same day, then the morning of said maybe it was possible....back and forth. After we saw the boat and we\\'re waiting (again) to hear from the broker about closing, I went around him and spoke to the closing coordinator, who actually new what she was doing and said it would be no problem to close same day (apparently the broker had no idea of this.) We also wasted about 1.5 hours because the broker didn\\'t make an effort to have the boat delivered to the closing office as we requested- which instead causes us to travel out of our way twice when we didn\\'t need to. There was no customer service from the broker- nothing was done by him to make the process as seamless as possible. I feel he didn\\'t have any experience in sales or in customer service. We were able to close the same day, which is not the norm for this company. With a different broker I would give them another shot.\\nAlways been helpful\\nIt\\'s great one click ordering and less than a week later contacts in the mailbox.\\njust recently bought macbook air and iPhone... and??\\r\\ni am alread head over the heel!!!\\r\\nthe unbelievable speed, the quality and the apps!!\\nCareington provides great discounted rates with various dentists.

I wasn\\'t able to log in for a month and a half and had to call to sign up for classes. The staff on site didn\\'t know how to fix it and wouldn\\'t take the obvious course of action to remedy the situation quickly—delete me from the system and re-enter all info from scratch. They were very helpful and seemed to be following orders, so it seemed to be a course of action from management. Eventually, we wiped the record and I was able to use the app properly. At the same time, my wife was still using the old app and hesitant to switch because of my problems. She eventually had to because she was going to lose her points in the old app. Although it makes sense to use this as a method to herd people into using the new app, it is strange that points could not be moved from one app to another.\\nGreat selection.

So far not very impressed with this company\\nI purchased One way fly to Venice, Italy on this justfly webside, and when I got to the counter at liberty airport in Newark, I have to pay $130.00 dólares for 1 piece of luggage,outrageous , there’s a lot of hidden thing they don’t tell you when you Athens the moment you are doing the booking.\\nNo fear.\\nMacs4u offers a high-quality product, easy and reasonable payment options and they went out of their way to make sure I got my Mac quickly and affordably.\\n\\nShort and sweet, they crushed the entire process. 5-stars easy.\\nThis is an excellent way to decorate your home.It was easy to use and just made the world of difference by putting the letters PANTRY on top of the pantry door.Lots of choices of colors and lettering styles to choose from will definitely do more with this company  G.Crews\\nWhere\\'s the Easy Button?\\nI needed the 10 books for a bible study and although they said they were used they exceeded my expectations. Delivery was very fast . Great job.\\nWebsite was informative (only wish there were more cuts reviews to help substantiate ratings).

Tired were installed in a timely manner. Overall, a very easy process and I feel good about my purchase.\\nWhen I called they had me with an agent forover 30 minutes. The gentleman was clueless, kept having to put me on hold. Then he screwed up the transaction and when I called back, i was on hold for 3 minutes and then someone picked up but never answered. You could hear the discussion in background. They are clueless on how to operate a call center. Zero customer focus.\\r\\nRun from Hotwire!\\nThank you for your service made it easy to apply\\nI\\'m short on time to elaborate.

Natural Alexandrite with it’s gemstone specific color change from blue/green to red/purple in my opinion is just a fabulous happening. I enjoy seeing her set so much that I wanted to get a stone for myself. \\nI found GemsNY on line. With emails and phone calls to Vishal describing what I was considering, we designed a 0.97 carat Alexandrite/0.36 carat diamonds mans ring. The stone is blue green to purple. The color “switching” is very strong; especially with the natural lighting fixtures we have in our home. I am very pleased.\\nFor anyone reading my notes here or on line, please feel very comfortable dealing with GemsNY.\\nCall or write after searching on line.

Easy to use website and all kinds of images that anyone could use. Quick check out, low fees and fast delivery (even by snail mail). Will definitely use again!\\nI bought a Groupon voucher and bought the scarves for about $7.50 a piece. The product came in a week and they wrapped it in a very good package. They have a lot of different varieties and colors which make it so hard to choose. The color was beautiful, I bought 4 solid pashmina in different colors and it all came even better from what I expected it. The material is soft and the quality is good. Soon as placed the order, i bought another voucher from Groupon. Now I just place my 2nd order with them. This would be a great Christmas presents. I\\'m looking forward for my second order to arrive. It\\'s definitely worth and i can see myself coming back here in the future. I would recommend those who loves scarves to check this site.\\nThey hurt like crazy .. not worth the money\\nGettington.com has been one of my GOTO online stores for holiday shopping for several years.

They always do a great job here.\\nWe ordered a Royal. with the second colour as Pink.  The bag received was Royal with White printing.  Not good, but I certainly am not going to the considerable expense of returning the purchase.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThere should be far more checking in overseas purchases to ensure they are correct as ordered.

True to size :)\\nI am moving out of state soon and have packed many of my belongings in anticipation of this move.  The boxes are in a storage facility with no easy access until my house sells.  I needed/wanted to cook a special dinner for friends but one of my favorite cookbooks was in storage.  I went online to Thriftbooks, found the cookbook ordered it and received in just a few days.

Is very easy to use and safety.\\nI\\'ve used cafepress for a few personalized gifts now (Father\\'s day, baby shower, etc.) and have found them to be high quality items with great customer service. One gift we ordered was time sensitive and when I contacted cafepress because the order didn\\'t arrive as expected, they quickly shipped a replacement, no questions asked (it ended up being a usps error- delivered to the wrong address). Prices are already reasonable and I can usually find a coupon online too. Overall very pleased!\\nWe received six fruit trees, all large and although dormant, appear to be in great shape. The two year old boysenberries look very healthy. I had two separate orders and don\\'t know why, but they shipped the second order first, which was kind of confusing.  But it worked out in the end. One more tree to go, to be shipped next spring. Hope they remember!\\nworked well. easy to use\\nRestaurants can be tricky to deal with but GrubHub always goes the extra mile to make sure I get my food. If there are any problems they are quick to respond and remedy the situation.\\nI recently ordered a vintage watch. Pam called me to tell me about an issue with the crystal and sent detailed pics. I confirmed that I wanted the watch and they sent it to me by overnight delivery. The watch is great!  The damage was not as serious as it looked in the pictures. I appreciate Pam\\'s honesty and great customer service.\\nI made it all by my self. I asked for my tax number bur couldnt find it where i was told is available. Maybe next time it will be beter.\\nLove all products I have purchased from Pearl Source.\\nI recently purchased a laptop. This was on Nov 15, 2015. Nov 17 the money came out of my account so on the 20th I checked online since I had not received any email about shipping, only an email confirming the order was received. It said the laptop was delivered to Jefferson, GA. Note I live in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada and the order was placed at TigerDirect.ca. I called and was told that this is standard. It is delivered to Tiger Direct warehouse and then shipped on to the customer and that it would now be routed directly to me and I would receive an email. That was 2 days ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nNever heard a thing so started sending emails to customer service. Eventually they cancelled the order stating the item was lost between the cross dock. However didn\\'t refund me some $15.62 for shipping and some other laptop charge. Now after another few emails I will receive $13. Then a few more and another $1.46. Finally after sending another email that the missing money they had charged for laptop disposal I will receive another $1.15. So only lost $0.01 and spent time sending 9 emails trying to get a solution to my order. Worst company I have ever dealt with online. I Will never deal with them again, neither will my company nor anyone I can suggest to buy elsewhere. Please do not waste your time shopping here. Customer service is a joke.\\nI have tried to get the attention of the company to report that the order I was charged for, was not complete. I have received no response. I won\\'t order from this company again.\\nI needed some parts for my RV generator and really wanted to have them before the next weekend\\'s trip.  I searched high and low on Amazon since I have Amazon Prime but was unable to find the parts I needed at a reasonable price.  Dyers came up in my search and they had the parts at a reasonable price and shipping was also reasonable.  The only question in my mind is whether or not I would get them in time.  I decided to give them a shot.  I placed the order on Sunday morning and my parts arrived on Wednesday afternoon.   I believe I paid $8 for regular shipping.  I got the parts installed on Wednesday night and our generator worked flawlessly for our weekend of tailgating.   This is great service and I will look to Dyers again when I am searching for RV parts and supplies.\\nI like that they keep me informed of what is happening with my account and they appear to  work hard for me.\\nI\\'ve used Just Fly several times now and it has been terrific. Very user friendly, set up a price alert with my trip details and they sent me notifications. Cheaper than booking directly through the airline too. Will definitely use them on my next trip.\\nOrdered items in 2017 to be billed for that calendar year, but credit card was not charged until January 2018 throwing off all budgeting.\\nRead some of the reviews and one mentioned taking a picture of the tumbler, which led me to finding the code I needed to order a replacement key for our file cabinet. Arrived within a week and now I am compliant with the law by locking up our new personnel files! Thank You!\\nThey arrived on time in good condition.\\nI ordered one hat, they sent two, and when I called them they gave me a refund and let me keep the hat.\\nEasy to use and navigate. nly issue is when you ask for lowest price and for that to be sent in an email, it doesn\\'t always give the lowest fares.\\nAwesome! a bit lengthy but prepares so well in a fun way!\\nMy recent experience was great. I called and talked to someone (which is hard to do on some other sites) and talked to someone about a part, and ordered that part. The part came fast and when it did not fit, it was simple to get it back and get a refund.\\nI do wish they carried more MK1 Cabriolet parts or differentiated them better. \\nI have to say again, the customer service is outstanding on ECS Tuning!!!!!\\nThis is now one of my main go to\\'s to get parts.\\nHighly recommended!\\nI love the format, and I\\'m definitely learning German through their immersion method.  The pictures can be ambiguous, though, and often require some thinking about what the picture is, rather than what I\\'m meant to understand in another language. If not for the frustration with this ambiguity, I would rate it 5 stars for the actual learning of another language.\\nI like Priceline for car rentals. I always use name your price and get great deals.\\nEncountered a dirty property and the host agreed to refund 50% on accommodation fees. AirBNB charges a Percentage on the accommodation fee, so I requested a 50% refund of the service fees. They kept saying the host short changed me. Asked me to file a claim against the host! But the monies refunded by the host tallies. It is the service fees that was withheld by AirBNB!\\nGreat selections outstanding quality. Will continue to purchase from their site.\\nI love to do business with this company.  They are very helpful.  I been doing business with them for a while.\\nI had and awesome experience for the 2nd time, this time around the only problem I had is with the delivery guys.

Picking seats was easy. Thank you!\\nI WAS ATTENDED BY SHELLY M. WITH A LOT OF EFFICIENCY.\\nExcelent products and service, congratulation\\nThis product arrived way quicker than expected so happy I didn\\'t order off of any other site. Products arrived blanketed by foam peanuts and wrapped well in a nice box just way more than I expected. You would think your ordering a 3000 dollar watch or something. Nice sample products as well.  Which def means something to me that you care enough to invest in yourself as a company and actually send them out to customers. Overall wonderful experience with this site. I used to buy in the mall near my house but vender moved further away so no I\\'m happy I found an even better way to get the product I really like. Thank you!\\nI admit it took a little longer than what I anticipated but once I was able to provide what they asked for, it moved quickly. The representative was very nice and explained everything very well. I had read reviews where people said they were asked for all these things and  then were not approved. I was fearful of that happening and then so elated when I got my approval. I would definitely recommend them to anyone needing a quick loan.\\nThey delivered on what they promised.  I could log on /off whenever I wanted. I liked the fact that they quizzed me after each section, so the material was fresh in my mind; and for the most part the final contained the material from the quizzes.  Even though no one likes to review this information I did learn a few things, especially about new laws.  I definitely recommend this class and even though I don\\'t expect to need it ever again, I would take it if I had to.\\nAlliance Security is a company that I want to secure my house through electronic monitoring. It is a company that takes the extra steps with customer service, reliability, and confidence to ensure that I feel safe.

He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire booking process.  He even displayed a great sense of humor.  I am very thankful that we were able to work with Gerardo to book our vacation.\\nBeautiful house, beautiful view, very likely to rent again one day!\\nI love using Thrift Books. My mom first told me about it when she ordered me a book I had long been meaning to read off of it. A couple of months later, I was searching for other books I really wanted to read, but trying to save money, I wasn\\'t sure if I could justify spending that much money on books. Then my mom reminded me of Thrift Books and the books came in the condition they said they were in and I\\'m super happy!\\nVery easy install 3m tape on back is great quality\\nStaff very helpful and explained everything very well!\\nFast, friendly, courteous service.

Vujin, esq.\\nThe people you deal with are all so professional, nice and easy to work with. Very fast response time. Dashboard is great and easy to use.\\nI recently (nov 16) hired a rental car via CarTrawler in Miami. The process of booking went smooth. No extra pop up boxes which try to sell you extras. Only one suggested insurance option (not three!, like other websites). A few days before I left for my trip to Miami I received a clear message (email) from Car trawler with instructions what document to bring with me and what kind of questions to expect at the rental desk and what to answer.\\nI came to Cartrawler via KLM\\nAlways have met my needs.\\nTaught me everything I needed to know with fun moments to keep me engaged.\\nEasy transaction\\nMan, I have to tell you!  I ordered a replacement headlight assembly for my old Nissan online from PartsGeek.com.  It arrived way before I thought it would. Even though it was an after market part, it appeared to be of good quality design and construction and it did not take too long to install.\\nItem was delivered promptly during a busy period and was as described.\\nI did not know what to expect when I first phone Select Quote as I was just calling for info after I saw a TV ad.  I cannot put into words how happy my husband and I are with the insurance plans that we were able to obtain.   The process was seamless and  my agent Greg was very professional.  The followup was outstanding.  Thank you so much\\nOverall, very nice items.  One item was left out of order, but is on its way after notifying NPD.  Deluxe interior stick-on wood pieces are, in one case, too small.  Too large pieces can be trimmed, but too small is not good.  Should have opted for more expensive set?\\nI would recommend this company. I had a very professional and personable representative, Chris. It is because of him that I am so happy with this company!!\\nI really liked service at WallyPark - made reservations, got a good price, had no trouble getting to the airport on time and back to our car when we came home. Good experience.\\nOK, I\\'m guilty.  I made the decision to switch all my domains from the other guy and come here.  All to save a couple bucks.  Big mistake.  My bad.  This hosting company is awful from the top down.  Nobody knows how to fix the even the most basic issues like billing.  You send them an email.  No response.  Then you call.  They place you on hold.  And explain in great detail the problem and they send you to another.  There help thingy on their web site is so out of date is not funny.  db operate on mysqli functionally which has been around FOR TWO YEARS!!!.  They don\\'t not have correct or current software to process this code.\\r\\n  Hey, if you have like one little site you might be OK.  But I truly don\\'t think they can handle even just one hosted domain.  The staff on the phone doesn\\'t even know how to work there own system!!.   It\\'s like the lights in the entire building got turned off and they\\'re just sitting in the dark.  Ummm.  OK,  there are plenty of hosting companies  out there that could serve your needs more effective other than H.G.  don\\'t think your gonna save money with these guys.  You will not.  \\r\\nI do not recommend H.G. \\r\\nI will be moving my domains from there server.\\r\\nGood luck\\nSure the designs are mine, but the quality of the sticker is incredible.

The most recent purchase included struts for my minivan. The price was the lowest anywhere, and the struts were delivered with in a couple of days. I had expected them delivered in a week! Parts Geek has me hooked. Any time I need a part they are the first ones I look for.\\nThe prices are great. I find Thrift Books to be superior to Amazon. The selection is outstanding. I will definitely purchase again!\\nEasy to use website, super fast free shipping and I like the idea of buying my supplements from a company that is dedicated to this.  Using a generic website with multiple sellers to buy something medically oriented makes me nervous about counterfeit items.  I trust PureFormulas\\nGreat company\\nCool design and the t-shirt is a nice, flattering fit. Thank you!!\\nNot bad but definitely could’ve been better!!  The ending part of my shopping experience was good.  The salesman was knowledgeable.  He assisted in helping me decide which car stereo and speakers I would end up buying.  The problems are this.  I was probably in your store for 5-10 minutes before someone “noticed” I was there interested in making a purchase.  My local store does not have an installer which sucks big time!\\nLarge inventory, good prices,products arrive quickly\\nAlways enjoy the shopping at Yamibuy\\nFind one that is not found in other sites\\nSo convinced\\nFrom the first phone call I made to inquire about ADT through out the entire process of installation completion, the services were excellent.\\nThe agent who assisted me, Jeff, was knowledge about the vehicles I looked at and very helpful at finding the right one at an affordable price.

Definitely recommending to others.\\nWe are very happy with our 2 products we brought from Dyers. They do ship orders very fast. We have sent others to Dyers. We will order again. Thank you\\nI was tasked to purchase a fridge for the office.  I was able to find something easily on-line which fit our budget.  I purchased the item then realized it was not the full size fridge we initially wanted.

They are the BEST, hands down.\\nA site with full of resources and quick response.\\nGreat agent in Jonathan for life insurance.

Thank for great pricing and quality merchandise 😀\\nThey sent and I received my refund, thank you CHW\\nI worked with Hovhannes and I was able to get help in a s month and easy process !\\nVery quick delivery of my order, with the book in very good condition, thank you.\\nArtwork arrived promptly, was framed and matted beautifully. Would definitely purchase through Saatchi again!\\nI found the Volvo gas cap I needed and it arrived surprisingly quickly.\\r\\nI guess it\\'s because the postage was twice the cost of the gas cap.\\nThey took very long to deliver my order and that too a bungled one! The health of my eyes is at stake here but they didn\\'t do a good job at this!\\nI called trying to locate a can dog food that the formula had recently changed. They were able to provide me with the original formula. Chris was very helpful in checking to make sure that they indeed had the original one that I was looking for. He even pointed out that it would be cheaper to buy the case. So glad I found this company. Items were shipped out the same day and I received them super fast.\\nGood service and quick response.\\nParts were exactly like I ordered and a perfect fit.  It is always a hard job working on a British auto and you know you can\\'t find these parts at a local auto shop so if you need hard to find parts at a good price and fast shipment, contact PartsGeek.\\nI\\'m very happy with the results of doing business with Thrift Books. I ended up using them because of the difficulty I encountered with a different company.  Not only is the site easy to navigate, my book arrived within the exact timeframe, no fuss, no muss.  You even have a choice of the condition you want your book to be in, of course a book in pristine condition will cost a little more than one with markings. All in all, my experience was a pleasant one and I will be using Thrift Books again, for sure.\\nFast shipping and love the stuff I purchased.\\nAlways the best prices. Will never go anyplace else for airfare!\\nGreat prices and ease of use succinctly describes my experience.\\nTyler M has been a great help to me for my first shipping with MyUS.com\\nFINALLY!

Thank you!\\nSpyware! keep away.\\nMy first order was shipped the same day, with free shipping and a free sample.  When my order arrived I read that there was free return shipping, which I did not need, but it was a nice surprise to know that it is there should I need it in the future.  So then I spent five minutes searching the PureFormulas website for any other benefits I had not seen while making my first order and I was again very pleased to find the multitude of companies they have on their website and the great coupons they offer.  Thank you, I will surely be using your website again, and I have already told my doctor about you too.\\nFound it, bought it. No fuss, no muss\\nProduct is as advertised; arrived earlier than expected.\\nThe Wolfenstein worked prefectly!\\nSuper great experience. :)\\nAbsolutely amazing!\\nEverything went great ans without any problems!\\nTrust & Will makes creating a will so easy and affordable. I always knew I needed one but avoided it through traditional methods because it seemed so difficult and expensive and didn’t know if any simple solutions. With Trust & Will, the process was super easy, quick to complete, and the finished product is perfect. I know that an update in the future will be the same now too! Thanks for this modern solution!\\nI\\'m truly grateful for my account with Gettington. This Company proves to the Customer that they really appreciate your business. Thanks so much for giving me a chance to purchase items, that was difficult to get other places.\\nI was looking for certain parts for one of my vehicles. I couldn\\'t not find them anywhere for a reasonable price. I found part geeks on line and there were my parts for literally 70% of the cost elsewhere. Looks great, feels smooth and paid less! Will shop again from this site.\\ngreat service, great rate!\\nExcellent customer services and happy to be with Kin Insurance\\nHad an airline cancel my flight, requested a refund. Confirmed that it was all well to go thru. It has been over a month, and still no refund.\\nI recently gave this company a try and found that the call quality is good, prices are good and unlike a calling card your balance is added to your next order.  Easy and fast very happy customer\\nVery happy with friendly services and a clean modern car.\\npicked up the car from nice airport on the 27th dec from a very poorly lite garage. the light was so bad the girl had a torch for us to inspect the car.\\nwe had to point out several markes on the car to her, all she kept saying was that will be ok don\\'t worry. basically she couldn\\'t care less. NOW on our return to a garage with flood lights and a girl who is going over it with a fine touth comb even on her knees under the car surprise she finds a mark under the car. this was not done by us  this is a scam by the company to fleece motorists off their money. they deducted 1100 euros from my card . and when the repair cost is taken from it they will reimburse the rest. luckeIy i purchased extra insurance in the uk .DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY\\nI chose Veterans United for a no money down VA Loan and they did a fantastic job from start to finish.  My loan officer, Daniel Heggarty, walked us through the process from pre-qualification, approval to closing.  They helped me find an agent and made sure the process was kept moving along.  When we started having delays with the listing agent, he got on it with both the listing and our agent to get things done.  We even got a check back from VU for using the agent they recommended and we got money back at closing too.  I really couldn\\'t have asked for anything more.  We love our new house!\\nGreat service, fast shipping\\nThanks for the service so far. Easy online usage, good communication following the booking. I thought the emails could be reduced slightly but not complaining - as more information is better. \\n\\nHopefully, the service will be as good when I pick up and drop the car. \\n\\nThanks.\\nProduct arrived as expected AND packaged so well there was zero damaged!!!!!  Great product and fulfilled my expectations!\\nIf you have time to wait for verification, even if you\\'re a member,  them use them. If you need quick service, use another site.\\nI wanted to pay using PayPal but was unable to have it work. Otherwise booking was painless.\\nThis was my first experience  with hotelsone.com and it was very straight forward, easy to get through, and very successful.\\nI ordered a monsterhook from you guys instead of from the direct manufacturer. You guys were about $40.00 cheaper and it arrived in 3 days. I love the hook, it was the final addition I needed for my king ranch. Thanks guys.\\nNot a quality product.  However the pictures were not expensive and will function as place holders until I find better.  They did not have any hanging material on them.\\nWeb site easy to navigate.  Shipping done quickly.\\nI ordered a pair of Serengeti Velocity Rx sunglasses October 2016. The first pair arrived within an acceptable time limit, obstacles taken into consideration (not FDs fault). These felt \"wrong\" when wearing them...as if my vision was skewed. A local optician checked the prescription, and showed me that the Pupil Distance was pretty far off! I wrote to FDs support, and was quickly contacted by JenniferC, who almost immediately sent me an RMA number. Returning the sungalasses took way too long, more than a month in transit (Christmas and all), but even BEFORE Jennifer had received my RMA frames, a new pair of Velocitys had been ordered, prepared and sent to me (I live in Denmark).\\n   Unfortunately, even this pair \"felt wrong\", and the PD was again shown to be off...just not as much this time. Still uncomfortable for me to use, though. It has later been admitted by Serengeti that they have had difficulties in producing an exact PD when making Base 8 wrap lenses (curved lenses), but some people it just doesn\\'t bother at all and they have no problem using them. Unfortunately not me. I\\'m really sorry that they couldn\\'t make them for me, because I love their glass/lens quality (and have for many years).\\n   JenniferC and AprilB have jumped through hoops to make me a satisfied customer, and we have agreed that I get the full amount that I have payed for the glasses back again. It won\\'t have cost me more than the amount of two return package-fares to find out that Velocity Rx\\'s didn\\'t work for me.\\n   I can with certainty say that FramesDirect has not made a nickel off of me ... quite the contrary ... and yet I am still an utterly satisfied customer. Why, you may ask, when you didn\\'t get what you wanted? Well, because of JenniferC and AprilB...they did what they could with more patience than I myself would have had. Cudos, girls, and thank you for your assistance. I will probably order from you again, when I find the right model!\\nVery nice slides. They are really comfy after long runs. They do get a little sweaty in the arches for me, but it could just be me. It keeps me from wearing them casually.\\nEverything was great except the $15 shipping fee and then noticing my flags started to tear after the first day of flying. The nylon that is claimed to be durable is not as durable as I would like.\\nGreat service. Van was waiting for us  when our plane landed. Used valet parking and our car was waiting for us when the van took us back to the garage. Doesn’t get better than that!!\\nDionne was very helpful. She helped me navigate the site and showed me a function with which I was unfamiliar. Thank you!!!\\nGreat product\\nBooking through GigSalad was so simple and effective. They have a great selection of musicians to choose from.  I definitely recommend GigSalad\\nI now prefer HomeAway to AirBnB.  Mainly because I wanted a place with specific features and was only able to search by specific location in Airbnb.  I didn\\'t know exactly where...but knew what I wanted so HomeAway was a much more satisfying search.\\n\\nthanks\\nGreat service. Reservations (online) were easy and car and driver were at my hotel on-time. Driver was professional and courteous. Actually, we had a very interesting conversation during the pleasant and safe trip. When I am in NYC, the only service I use is Dial 7. Well worth the affordable price. Thanks!\\nI would use this company again! It worked out well\\nMy cat has a chronic condition that requires him to be on medication for life...which means, taking time of to call my vet and drive to her office to pick the med. VetRxDirect has simplified that process.\\nHad a great expierence at our local Home Zone, no pushy salesman our being bombarded by every employee we crossed. Appreciate the service we received our salesman Bryce was very informative and knowledgable then left us to decide on our own. Our new furniture is set to arrive this Thursday and we our very excited. Thanks so much for making our expierence at Home Zone a very positive one.\\nHighTechSeating delivered me my chair when promised and I saved a ton of money on my Aeron Chair. Highly recommended!!\\nI couldn\\'t believe how fast my order got to me, in Hawaii, and I even requested a font that wasn\\'t listed.\\nDon\\'t waste your money or time. I bought a part for my car and got a broken part after waiting 4 days. This is for my main car I use to drive to school and couldn\\'t. I called and they have good constomer service. I got a replacement and received a faulty part.  I found out after I got it installed in my car. It\\'s not even a OEM part. Which the website promises. Don\\'t waste your time and money. There constomer service hours are terrible and it feels like I can\\'t get in touch with the company. They need to start checking the parts the junk yards are sending because they are sending bad parts  and cheap parts.\\nI ordered the smallest custom stamp and was worried the detail would get lost, but it turned out great!\\nThey are extremely responsive to my needs. Whenever I call my questions are answered promptly.\\nGift arrived as expected and email confirmation sent immediately. I am overseas and my father was admitted to hospital.

Great team to work with.\\nIt would be mice yo have special deal where you don\\'t have to buy 24 sets.\\nLetters were as ordered and looked good.  Letters were somewhat hard to remove from the top cover.  It took a lot of patience.\\nNice clothes and great price\\nGreat survey site!Fun surveys,generous rewards!\\nI ordered 100 4\"x5\" clear zip bags for $4 plus $7.25 shipping.  I had meant to order 200 bags.  I called Customer Service to explain that I wanted another 100 bags but found the postage to be prohibitive.  I am the Infantwear Buyer for the Assistance League of Austin and package onesies in the small baggies for donating to at-risk and under-served preemies and infants at Dell Children\\'s Hospital.  The person I spoke with graciously offered to send another package for $2 shipping.  I appreciated that very much but then wondered why the original shipping was $7.25 if the product could be shipped for $2.  For the additional $5.25 that I paid the first time, I could\\'ve had another 100 bags for $4 with a little left over!  That would\\'ve been great!  Since I am spending the Assistance League\\'s money, I am especially aware of extra spending.  Thank you for a good product and fast shipping, but not the $7.25 shipping cost!\\nVery professional customer service representatives. Quick and easy application.\\nEasy, quick, and efficient!\\nVery Helpful and returned my call after I had a question great customer service\\nIt\\'s beautiful! Wish I had gotten it in a bigger size.

It\\'s wonderful being able to attend so many shows at a great discount.  Being a Red Velvet member has enabled me to get the best seats at a great price...so glad a friend recommended Goldstar to me. Join now!!\\nMy PetFlow order for Zukes chew bones came fast , my order was complete and product was fresh. My dogs love Zukes bones thier teeth have noticeably become cleaner and the doggy breath is going bye-bye.  Thanks PetFow for offering a service like this, I also like the availability of buying bulk pack sizes of chew bones, as my local pet store only sells them in individual packs. This is a cost savings for me and I don\\'t have to worry about running out with the auto-ship feature.\\nExcellent communication, knew exactly when my plants would arrive.  Plants I received were a nice size and very healthy.\\nI have used Bake Me a Wish numerous times over the years to send a special birthday treat to my family members.

Thank!!!\\nSkype 8.\\nvery bad interface\\nI\\'ve been ordering from SupplementWarehouse.com for a couple of years now and consistently they have the best prices and quick delivery. I like the fact that they provide samples with the shipping of my ordered products. It allows me the opportunity to test different brands I normally would not try.\\nExellent service,everything came as ordered no mixups, fast shipping thanks again\\nIT WAS O K !!!!\\nI was skeptical on using a car service I never used before, especially coming out of JFK. After pressing the notification button letting my driver know that he was minutes away, I was nervous not knowing if he would be there or having to wait a long period of time. Andulla, our driver was there in minutes. He was courteous and got us to our final destination safely.\\nThe dates came faster than expected. The packaging was above and beyond my expectations (more than what you would have received from a store). The size chart was very accurate. I 100% would order from them again.\\nBest place to buy books!!\\nI NEED THE ROOMS TO BE HANDICAP ACCESSIBLE. NO OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE TO INCLUDE PRICING.\\nThe process of selling was very simple.

I\\'ve had mixed results on the quality and style of the clothes.\\nGreat service! Speedy delivery! Recommend!\\nWe use Stamps.com because Amazon does not offer all of the USPS shipping options. We ship a lot of regional rate boxes and a ton of padded flat rate envelopes, none of which are available through Amazon.\\r\\nThere are features that aren\\'t easy to deal with and communication is not that easy either.\\nWasn’t shipped out for a week after ordered an item was namebrand very good quality price was very good shipping cost was good would buy from again\\nI was in need of quality storage space. I had called to book the space for a certain date. As it turned out the requirement occurred a day early. The van load was due at the storage within a short time.

Such talented art work by all.\\nI recommend Hardware Source!  The website was decent.  I suppose there could be some room for improvement in helping to understand better how which parts go best together.  It was a little work making sure I was choosing the correct pieces for my application.  Maybe a system where I can enter my parameters and it gives me all of my choices paired with the right screws, plates, etc. so I can choose them easier.  Having said that, the information that WAS given was very helpful in figuring it all out.  More important was the fact that someone called me within just a couple hours of placing my order to go over an issue with me.  I don\\'t expect they call everyone, but I had a large order and there was a slight issue that they resolved with me.  I was very impressed.  I received everything when it was expected and it was packaged well with no damage etc.  And I felt the prices were very good.  I will order from them again if/when I need something that they have.\\nOne day delivery! Display case is exactly what I wanted for a great price\\nThis program was so easy to understand.\\nThis is  probably my 5th purchase from you guys and I\\'m always blown away by the effort you put into the packaging.

Their quality is much better than expected for the price so I am very pleased. The pins look great on my new hat and I am looking forward to Oktoberfest! Thank you, GermainSteins.com.\\nservice was prompt, accurate and as promised.\\nWe had truly satisfying experience when we used Rover to care for our dog.\\nI\\'ve booked hotels, flights, cars and packages using Bookit for travel to many countries and continents. I am never disappointed in their recommendations and their prices always beat competitors and direct sources (like airline websites)\\r\\nThe only hurdle I have ever run into is trying to cancel a flight that I booked through them. Both Bookit and the airline gave me the run around. One issue out of 25+ bookings is pretty minor.\\nAwesome license plate for my Fiat\\nHighly Impressed by service received from Ruchi Gulati. Good communication, quick service and very professional. She went over and beyond to offer me all possible options with prices better than MakeMyTrip website. Even talked to her supervisor to get me additional discount.\\nI was fortunate to have Marie as the representative to help me with my booking. Not only did she explain everything very clearly, as well as provide   addresses for me to look up for where it would be most convenent for me to drop off my rental car among three downtown choices, but she also gave me a great price! I felt very comfortable that she gave me all the information needed to make a for a \\'no surprises\\' experience.\\nMy husband and I subscribed for our anniversary gift to each other and we absolutely love it!

Kept blaming things on new email and warehouse after they took the money.  Had to beg to get correct order sent.   \\n\\nThere are other companies that want the business and have better customer service.  \\n\\nCustomer service training needed ASAP!!\\nThe shakes are very good and filling and I would recommend this product to others, but it\\'s very expensive.\\r\\nI did have trouble with the site and I ended up getting a duplicate order.\\r\\nI did not get any confirmation on my order and I haven\\'t heard from anyone until now to write this review.\\r\\nThank you for letting me have this opportunity to let you know that I won\\'t be ordering anything from you again. \\r\\nKaren\\nI love the ease if shopping at PureFormulas!\\nIt came quicker than expected and I love the quality!\\nHotel Marina El Cid was 5-star all the way...restaurants, service, beach, convenience, cleanliness, terrific room and facilities.  There was a problem with the Vacation Express (Nexxus?) person who was not where he or she was supposed to be (for hours) to let us know when the shuttle would be picking us up, and we spent a fair amount of time trying to find this simple but essential bit of information.  We would have preferred to be spending our last day on the beach, relaxing, instead of pursuing someone who did not show up for work.  The hotel itself was extraordinary.  This was our 7th Mexico (Cancun or Riviera Maya) trip with Vacation Express and one of the best places to stay.  We have nothing but praise for the hotel.\\nI wanted to buy a particular model(RX5228) of Ray-Ban eyeglasses, which I couldn\\'t find anywhere in my hometown so I thought of ordering it on Lenskart based on trust and their reputation. But the problem was that I had no idea on how to enter the power details, so I went to the store to order them.The representative at the store assured me that the glasses were under \"14 days no questions asked return promise\"(WHICH IS THE BIGGEST SCAM) and I\\'d be given a refund as I had not seen the glasses physically and that I had no idea that it would fit my face. Then the glasses were delivered and found that the print in the temples were of inferior quality and would fade away in time and would like the same model in pure black colour. And now I call the store, and they tell me that they accept returns(how the hell am I supposed to know if the glasses look good on me without trying it?) only for their in-house brands(Vincent chase and John Jacobs). I\\'ve called the customer care and they\\'re just stalling for time so that the 14 day period ends and they can just shrug it off! Worst experience and waste of Rs 6700/-. Would never buy from Lenskart again and recommend you not to throw your hard earned money down the drain. I\\'ve still got the ticket details if you doubt me.\\n\\nLENSKART DOWN DOWN!!\\n\\nEdit 1: Date: 24/10/2017\\nThe store accepted the return(Order no:1212966821) and selected another pair of glasses for which I haven\\'t yet received the order confirmation in my mail, by then I\\'ll post the new order number. Please make sure at least this time I\\'m satisfied with the service and the product. I\\'m not ready for another bad experience. Thank you Trustpilot! And thank you Lenskart for addressing the problem and rectifying it. \\n\\nMoreover I\\'m not taking down the review until and unless I\\'m satisfied with the new product.\\n\\nEdit 2: 25/10/17\\n\\nThe new order number is 1213030500. The customer care executive promised that it’s on their priority and waiting with my fingers crossed.\\n\\nEdit 3: 26/10/17\\nMY GOD!! I CAN’T BELIEVE THIS. I’VE BEEN PROVIDING THE ORDER DETAILS BY EDIT AS I WAS NOT ABLE TO REPLY TO YOUR COMMENTS. PLEASE NOTICE THIS!!\\nI have worked with Thriftbooks now for several years...and have been always treated right...with efficiency and care .This is an outstanding resource and service!\\nthey follow thru with all that they say.its fast and easy\\nThis is my first transaction with Fabletics. I ordered two pair of leggings and two matching sports bras. I\\'m hoping they fit and look great!!\\nGeekly Lab was very helpful in assisting in understanding course concepts better.\\nWe had an awesome time on our Yosemite tour. This is definitely the best way to see the park if you have limited time. Our guide and bus driver were both very friendly and helpful. If we were to do it again we would choose the tour without the sequoia hike so as to get more time in the valley itself.\\nI did alot of research on the net about silk sheets, LilySilk had the best reviews from others so I took the chance. Boy they did not dissapoint with the quality. Absolutely a great investment I made as I am making more of a investment in my sleep. Bought the fiteed sheets with the top sheet and 2 pillow cases. Comfortable, keeps me cool and the fabric feels great agaianst your skin. Shipping was good, not long, within a week I believe. I have not washed them yet but will be meticulous cause I don\\'t want to ruin them. Will buy the Duvet when I save a little more.\\nDherbs products are amazing. He has an herbal, organic remedy for a plethora of conditions. The products that Dherbs sell range from something as simple as a cold remedy to something as serious as a tumor remedy.\\r\\n If you write a review on a product that you have tried, the next time you order you get a 10% discount. That surely is an added bonus.\\r\\n If i could change anything, it would be the fact that I have tried and used so many of his products that I can never remember what product I have written a review on. So I always have a hassle trying to get my discount code.\\r\\n If my opinion matters, try to incorporate a link that customers can click to list the products they have written reviews on. \\r\\nThanks Dherbs for all that you do. I am a loyal customers, and I have been for several years.\\nI am a latest victim and sent out my money without reply and response from their staff.

Thanks so much for excellent service!\\nit was easy prompt and the clerk was very professional.I recommend this service to everyone.\\nI like the service. It was on time and very good price. Thanks\\nFor the most part, I love this bank.  Not only does a simple checking account accrue positive interest, you are reimbursed for ATM fees (up to $15 per month I believe...).  I\\'ve even used them internationally, and you are charged a reasonable 1% fee.\\n\\nThere are 2 minor drawbacks.  \\n1. You cannot deposit cash as there are no physical banks to go to.\\n2. Once you run out of the first batch of 50(?) checks they give you, you must purchase more.  This is not included.\\n\\nOverall, I am very happy with this bank.\\nBooking my vacation was simple, as nd the prices were great. When a problem came up with our flight Vacation Express was there to send all the information  to the resort.\\nThe books arrived on time.  Service by Springer was great!!\\nBetter than all the rest\\nVery disappointed in the level of customer service. The part was incorrect when we received it too. It was built the wrong way.\\nI have ordered 3 times from Get Run in the past 6 years and they have been very responsive and reliable.\\nGood products.  We use clear bags, backing board and high quality recycled envelopes.  Vendor now offers an inexpensive shipping choice.\\nThis was my first time using the service. They are very professional and efficient. There was someone there to pick us up by the time we walked to the meeting spot. My car was ready and warmed up when we got back to the lot. They are worth a try.\\nSmooth service -- passport arrived as promised and instructions were easy to follow.\\nThe only reason it is not a 5 star is because it has not yet funded. Will know more at that time.\\nInformative, polite. Honest. Great experience\\nMarcus was great.\\nI have not received my purchase. I am very upset to be charged shipping. I wonder if I\\'ll get it before Christmas.\\nVery good price and very easy  to make a reservation. Thanks\\nI had previously tried to purchase life insurance, but it never worked out.  There were too few quotes, it took way too long and there was always some problem with documentation.  PG was able to quickly process my paperwork and I got a policy that made me happy.  I would recommend them to anyone.\\nThe customer service was superb. The orders were handled promptly and proofs were sent quickly. Products arrived exactly as described and are a perfect addition to our Board room! THANK YOU!\\nOne of the worst shipping companies out there.  I have a package autoshipped every 10 days.  At first the package arrived in 3 days.  Now it takes at least 2 weeks.  I follow the tracking and it stops in my state then goes to Georgia then Florida before it comes back to North Carolina.  I would NEVER ship anything with them.  Unfortunately most of the companies I work with use them.  I am now only dealing with companies that use UPS.\\n... be prepared to spent 30-40 minutes fighting with the unpacking, and cutting up a HUGE shipping box!!!!  I\\'M SERIOUS!!!  I recently ordered a frame (12x36) with matt board and plexiglass (not glass).  My wife helped me carry a HUGE box into the house, and after about half an hour of cutting through layers of very thick cardboard, the unpacking was finally complete and we had a HUGE pile of cut up cardboard and packing material... what an incredible waste!!  I contacted them and sent pictures.  I told them to please stop this unnecessary overkill... they ignored my suggestion.  I just received a smaller order (11x14) and you would think I ordered quantity 10 by the size of the box!!!  LOVE their products, I am tired of hauling piles of cardboard to the recycle center because there is so much with each order it will not fit in my recycle bin!!\\nCustomer Service and product were perfect I couldn\\'t have asked for better. I will definitely be shopping here again. I\\'ve already recommended to friends\\nit was a great website for job seekers\\nOldies service was excellent. DVDs could have had better quality of picture, but that is not Oldies fault but the company who transferred the original prints. I know these are old films but I bought a 1939 film which was so clear it could have been made yesterday.\\nThere isn\\'t a number to call for customer service and the one I found doesn\\'t work (949) 273-6202. My order is over a month late and there is no straight answer nor update. It says was ready to be shipped and that\\'s it. Best tshirts ever but service is slow and inefficient\\nGreat price for items, shipped quickly, but did NOT receive refurbished HP ink cartriges as ordered, but generics instead which my printer continues to state not full as it does not acknowledge these cartriges.\\nOur order came quickly after we placed it, and the quality is great!

If you can use the internet, you can use Rover.com.\\nKarmaloop always have discounts and have good clothing that will certainly appeal to anyones ideal fashion style.\\nReceived the order and the delivery driver noted that the box containing the agaecide was wet.

All were very positive.  The responses I received, even late in the day, were very prompt and complete.\\nOur travel consultant was very knowledgeable and helpful. However he and us had difficulty with SkyLux\\'s processing of our credit card payment. Capitalone initially knocked back the payment because their computers were suspicious of the nationality and nature of the charge. After my phone calls to them they approved the transaction.

But I got one used book that was in very poor condition--looked like a child drew a circle with a pen on each page. It was just for home reference, and a good price, but I was sort of surprised that this book was even sold. I\\'m glad I wasn\\'t planning to give it as a gift, as I was one of the other used books I ordered, that was in great shape! So, sort of mixed results for me from my order. : /\\nNo problems. Great customer service.\\nI\\'m so excited to work with such lovely ladies I so look forward for what\\'s yet to come\\nWhile it\\'s working, the quality of phone calls is ABS great!! Using an ATA enables me to use regular phones and there is a software (Windows) app that enables me to take my phone with me as I travel, which is FANTASTIC.\\n\\nBut... our calls are seemingly, randomly dropped after 10-55 minutes which is extraordinarily frustrating. I am looking at the ATA provider first (OBI200/202) for this problem. The softphone app has its own set of issues, such as the inability to answer if I have the headset selected as the speaker (no problem answering if I use the computer speaker).\\n\\nFor these two issues, I\\'ve taken stars off. As these issues are resolved, I will update (if I can) this review. It is my plan to use Phone Power for my residential line (yeah, yeah) replacing Vonage, and for each of our business lines replacing Skype -- my partner & I each have home/remote offices when we are not on site with customers -- separate businesses.\\n\\nAdding on to the original review, Tech Support sent me a link for additional information that identified additional port ranges to allow that seems to be key in my dropped calls issue. Since implementing these _additional_ ports, dropped calls have...  dropped off.\\nEverything was so easy and I got the plants I wanted!!\\nReturned an item, still no refund a month later. Takes a couple days to get return email when I inquire about getting a refund. I\\'ve used other online auto parts vendors and had a great no hassle RMA when needed.

Would highly recommend!\\nGreat prices... Had trouble signing in to start with. Once on though it was great.\\nI trust the DHA 500\\nI ordered a book for school from them.  After almost 2 weeks I finally contacted them via online chat because you cant call them anywhere and was told that they didn\\'t have the book.  Even the day I contacted them their automated system said that they were still preparing the order for shipment.  You better not depend on this book store unless you really don\\'t need the book for a purpose other than pleasure.\\nAn order previously sent  by hale groves was delivered as scheduled in Bayside NY but was stolen from the doorstep by persons unknown and my step daughter didn\\'t receive my gift, when I called Hale Groves customer service line I was told not to worry they would resend the order for me, how wonderful of them..I give them 10☆\\nthey were very pleasant and easy to work with\\nthis is the second time I have ordered these night gowns and I love them they are so comfortable and wash up nicely with out shrinking\\nA great company to do business with, good price , good customer service, delivered quickly, I\\'m very satisfied with them , I will do business again.\\nI was very happy to discover Squeeze Pod.

Keep up the good job Justfly\\nQuality what was expected and the price was fantastic preciate it.\\nI have been purchasing Groupons for years and was taken aback by  their unwillingness to honor my request of a credit for a groupon because the restaurant closed before I was able to redeem it.

The price was great, delivery was quick, engraving was perfect.  If only shipping was free!!\\nVery easy to maneuver around the site!!\\nFast service pick up and drop off.  Close to airport. Easy access off freeway.  Driver was very nice.  Cashier could have been a bit more pleasant. Overall good experience first time using them.  Would use again.\\nFor the most part, Topcashback has been a winner. I have had two incidents where I had to file a claim, but I\\'ve received cash back for over 10 transactions, so the odds are in my favor!\\nI place my order on Jan. 5, 2018.  As of Jan 16,2018 I have not received my product.  I received an email that stated it was denied at my home that no one with my name lived there.  NOT TRUE Then I received an email stating that the merchandise was damaged.  I call customer service 3 days ago and no one has yet to return my call.   NOT COOL\\nI searched for days before buying these tickets to Italy. I routinely came back to Just Fly to check prices. Once I choose my flights, booking was easy, and the info was emailed immediately. My only complaint was the choose my seat charge. I chose to do so while flying across the ocean however, and it added a bit to the total. I think it will be worth it.\\nAceable was great!! Great way of learning the rules of the road and allows you to receive this education quickly and effectively.\\nI\\'ve only been with Hostinger for a little over 6 months, but I couldn\\'t be happier then I am at the moment with their service and support.\\n\\nIn the time that I\\'ve been using their service, I have experienced zero unexpected down time, and they have delivered everything as expected.\\n\\nAs for their support, there aren\\'t enough good things to say about them.  They are seldom more then a couple minutes away from a response to my inquiries, no matter what time of day or night.  And their support staff has shown themselves to be extremely knowledgeable, and able to quickly resolve each situation for me.\\n\\nI would recommend Hostinger to anyone looking for secure, affordable Hosting and Domain services...\\nWe have used American frame for several years in our photography.  Special sized frames work every time.  Five stars\\nTreatments are much easier than I thought. I like the easy scheduling options.\\nExcellent service! Have used Xoom for a number years now. Love it!\\nIt was easy to do and the money came quickly.\\nI really like it that this company often has a 20% off sale for larger orders. This allows me to order all the items I need at a great discount, which is great since I own several large breed dogs. The only thing that could be improved is if this company would carry Dr. Tim\\'s food. I still have to buy that elsewhere.\\nAccidentally booked the wrong date, and on the date itself priceline was able to fix the mistake in 30 minutes.\\nGreat pricing and service!  Book was in excellent condition, as represented.\\nIt was a great experience. Almost every topic required is covered in this course. This gave me confidence to hit the road.\\nSo convenient!

However, these guys are one of the few that can pull it off.  Exceptional for obtaining hard to find refills at very reasonable prices with very quick turn-around. I consider them one of my trusted vendors.\\nWe have accidentally set the alarm off twice.  They have been very prompt in responding.  This gives me confidence in knowing that if the alarm is real, their response will be prompt.  It gives me peace of mind knowing they are looking after my home.\\nI have never been fooled by whatever I purchased from Oldies.com.

These will be used in a mural/Mosaic for a living room\\nI purchased several books through Thriftbooks.com and they all came promptly and in exactly the condition they were described as (good). With cheap prices, and free shipping in the U.S I was skeptical at first. But they kept me updated about the product location with free tracking and even shipped with a recyclable bag. On top of that the books they don\\'t sell, they recycle. This is a top website for buying used books. And the books I purchased look brand new. \\r\\n\\r\\nTip for the wise, don\\'t expect every book to be perfect, these ARE used. If it is listed below good there is a higher chance that they will be more roughly worn.\\nI can\\'t believe something like this would have worked, but I\\'m writing this review from my unlocked phone.

Can\\'t wait to see everyone wearing them Christmas Day!!\\nWas lied to about the help I would receive from the sales person. Sales said all gutters would be washed and leveled before the shield install - did not happen.\\nWasn\\'t told that it would be very common to have to have ugly valley shields installed after the initial install could not keep up with the water.\\n\\nin certain areas you can see the guard sticking up and was told due to the gutter installation method.\\nI would rate a 4 or 5 star if it were not for the storage increasing fees about every 6 months just because.

You can\\'t ask for more than that.\\nBought a used 2015 Chevrolet equinox from wesley chapel Honda, at first everyone was great then once paper work was done service went down hill. We left with an empty gas tank, the finance deparment didn\\'t hold their end of the deal, instead we were basically told we are saving 2000 dollars in the long run and to take the deal or get a higher interest rate.  We had agreed to put 1000 down if they came down 1000 from the price our our vehicle they counteracted and said they would bring down the offer if we put 1210.70. We agreed and in the end they did not hold up their end of the deal or disclose they weren\\'t going to either.\\nI hate the fact that you don\\'t ship directly to me - but instead mail the shipment first to your Las Vegas terminal.  It grates that I live so close to Portland,Or, but you insist on shipping the order first all the way down to Nevada and then days later back up to the Northwest.\\nThis was my first time booking on Justfly.com and it was the best value that i was able to find and was a seamless process!!

We also enjoyed the giant fireplace.\\nWe would love to come back to this home when it\\'s warm weather to enjoy the outdoor decks and creek.\\nThe website has a lot of info on what you can use the pass for and any special entrances Etc to help you use the card.

So then I was going to take my water into the city (45 miles away) to a lab to test for minerals, etc.\\r\\nbut came across this water test kit on the internet. I found it easy to use and I was pleased to find the only thing out of line is the ph (is 6 -not a big deal).\\r\\nMeanwhile, I have been having bottled water delivered to my home. Recently I had a bad experience with the bottled water I had trusted to be clean, pure, and safe.

I am back in HI with no option to get correct order from Pts gk.\\nThere needs to be a much closer correspondence between the automobiles shown in the AutoEurope car selection menu and the one that\\'s actually offered by the rental companies. I ordered a Mercedes A type with 4 doors and a hatchback, and was offered a Renault Megane with two doors, no luggage space, and a convertible hardtop! Useless!

They cancelled it 2 days before we turned up at the hotel . 2 days in which they failed to contact me via the verified email address that they had for me or the 2 phone numbers on file. I was stuck in Milan with 2 small children in a fully booked hotel, (they had rebooked our room to another customer). An unhelpful customer service provider at Agoda just made lots of excuses, none valid. We managed to find another family room, difficult in Milan, for twice the price with the help of the original hotel staff. They were as cross with Agoda as I was. Never trust Agoda, book direct with the hotel or use other booking sites. We have never had trouble with Booking.com or TripAdvisor.\\nI will never use Agoda again.\\nExcellent quality and service. Changed the shipping address in the middle of the order, they answered and acted immediately.\\nvery reliable\\nThe website is helpful and there are many choices. I esp like the eco stamp,  th one I ordered turned out great.  I called to clarify a couple of questions and the attendant only redirected me to the website, not at all helpful !\\nOlshan accomplished foundation stabilization as well as water leak repairs. Their customer service and work quality has exceeded all expectations. When the initial foundation repair did not work as hoped they absolutely stood behind their warranty (even when they technically may not have had to) and replaced the repair with a new stabilization system that had come out at no expense to me. As they have always gone the extra mile I can heartily recommend Olshan for your foundation repairs - you won’t be sorry!\\ngood right now for one\\nEverything arrived packaged carefully and at the right time to plant. Very highly recommended!\\nHappy with product, came in timely manner, packaged well.  Great experience.\\nJust got the most amazing dress for a very good price!

Made a selfie With my credit card. \\nGave them a Copy of my ID. \\nDid everything compliant to their demands. \\nThey immediately took my €300 of my credit card. \\nThen after 5 days my bitcoins were cancelled, the reason: \\nBecause the price I bought them for was not the price they are now!!! \\n\\nThey offered me make another purchase where the actual price is more conform the current market price. \\n\\nThat’s illegal. And total BS. \\n\\nBecause Simplex is slow.\\nI can’t buy bitcoins at a lower price. And they just simply cancel my order. \\n\\nNo reply what so ever on my complaints. \\nAnd that’s that. \\n\\nDutch authorities are notified.\\nOrdered two Christmas gifts.  One received, one not. Quality of fruit was good.  Customer service awful!!  If something goes wrong with an order, they will make it right, but it takes at least three days to get to talk to someone.  One Christmas gift never received, they will replace it, but not till mid January.  They said it was damaged and could not be delivered, but never notified us.   No apology, no credit, just rudeness.  Will we order again?  Not sure.  Depends if Christmas gift gets there mid January and if fruit is good.\\nGreat prices and very good selection of books.  Best deal in town on shipping!! No one beats their shipping rates and speed of delivery. I highly recommend Thrift Books to one and all.\\nThe sales person was extremely polite and really made our experience awesome. Highly recommend him! \\nWas also impressed by the latest technology there.

The artwork turned really great and I was pleasantly surprised by how sharp the print was.\\n\\nLook forward to working with Vannesa and FlashBay in the future.\\nYou guys really made designing and ordering our display simple. We took it to a trade show last week and it got rave reviews by the attendees and other exhibitors. The way you have pieces marked makes set up foolproof.  Well done! One man took the information we had for your company and he plans to order one of your products. \\r\\nWe were not happy with the podium at all - we think it looks rather tacky - so we did not use it. We ordered and used one from another company. If you could \"fix\" that, you\\'re the company to beat. The podium is the only reason we cannot give you 5 stars.\\nBeautiful looking product, easy to apply.  Fast turnaround.\\nI had never use UShip before, but was faced with trying to find ways to get six dirt bikes from all over the USA back home. It was interesting but it all worked and i was happy with the cost and condition of my bikes. Not a bad way to ship.\\nI\\'m a wife and mother returning to school. The last thing I have is time to waste. This site was user friendly and was easy to locate my books. I paid a few dollars for express delivery and it arrived even earlier than the guaranteed arrival date. I have shared this site with my classmates and my teachers as well. The prices were very reasonable, even though I purchased used books. I\\'m very satisfied with my experience- no problems. Infact, I was only looking for one book and I found both books that I needed. It\\'s the only site I will use to purchase text books!\\nIT IS VERY USEFUL TO YOUNG GENERATION TO GET A SUITABLE JOB OPPORTUNITY.

I love the variations and color theme which goes with my neutral decor.  I highly recommend this company and their products.  I will be purchasing more!\\nSite was easy to use but a little difficult to figure out the prices. It shows one rate at first and then a higher rate at checkout that doesn\\'t add up even after concidering the trip insurance fee. ??\\nGreat experience, awesome cabin, incredible vacation, very peaceful and relaxing!\\nAs it says in the title ;)\\n\\n<3 Jani\\nOn June 8 I bought three books to be given as a present to the keynote speakers in a Conference, one week before the conference. Just after accepting the order, I realized that I didn\\'t choose the express shipment option (which is in my opinion not clearly visible), and I sent an e-mail to orders-HD-individuals@springer.com, asking if it were possible to change the shipment option or, at least, to know if the books would arrive in one week, to be able to react and place a new express order.  One and a half day after, I received an apparently automatic response telling  \"Please be informed that upon checking on our system, we could no longer change the address as well as the mode of shipment since the book was already delivered on June 6, 2014\" , a wrong date, before the order date, which was really sent on June 10 according to the invoice and, what is worst, no answer to my question about the delivery time. The Books arrived on June 18, after the conference end.\\r\\nThe customers deserve something more that the answer of a robot.\\nBeing that my wife and I were going through the home purchase process for the first time, Quicken made us feel comfortable and answered all our questions.\\nI kept my eye on the rates and got a great deal\\nGreat customer service in a timely manner.\\nEasy to order on the website.  Lots of great info about the products, with links to other sources too, so helpful when making a decision as to whether a particular product is right for you.  Easy to track parcel and delivered quickly.  Have used before and also great service then. A business it is safe to trust.  One of my favourites.\\nVery good customer service.\\n\\nI have spent nearly 20k with Leibish over the years and the service and attention to detail has been the same no matter if it was a 2k order or a 10k one.\\nQuick shipping.  Beautiful ring!!!!! Would highly recommend!!!\\nGreat place to stay\\nEasy access to downtown but not in the thick of things\\nEverything we needed at the house\\nI bought minecraft windows 10. Is was cheap and fast and it was also safe. :)\\nI\\'ve had an absolutely horrible experience with trustedhousesitter. It was bad enough to receive a review based on blatant falsehoods it\\'s another to have to deal with an unsupportive and indifferent customer support team. Carla, the support representative did little to mollify a bad situation. I felt like I wasn\\'t listened to, or that I was met with any degree of empathy.\\nThere is absolutely no 24/7 support! My numerous phone calls went to voice mail. My attempts to live chat was met with an automated response. Just a chain of back and forth emails.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a homeowner and a serious situation arises like someone trashing your home or not properly caring for your pet, or if you\\'re a sitter and the homeowner tells blatant lies about you, you\\'ll have no recourse. I\\'m sure in a perfect world house sitting is a great win/win situation. But in the real world things aren\\'t perfect. And my experience is that Trustedhousesitter is ill-equipped to deal with these events.\\n\\nMark Ruggieri \\nCalifornia, USA\\nThe unit we stayed in has been completely remodeled. We have been coming for several years and this year was the best. The kitchen was very well stocked. The only area that needs attention is the carpet in the doorways of the bedrooms. It’s coming up and the sharp carpet nails are exposed in 2 of the bedrooms. We had to be careful as we had a one year old crawling and put towels down to avoid any injury to her. Other than that it was an awesome experience and would seek this unit out again.\\nCalifornia Delicious is a great place to purchase gifts since they add a personal feel to their packaging. Makes the recipient feel that that I\\'ve really taken my time choosing and preparing the gift to them.\\nI got my dermawand in the mail and it\\'s pink not white and the logo isn\\'t even on the device. I\\'ve used it per directions for two weeks and there is literally no difference whatsoever. The dermavital skin products are nice, though.\\nvery good help, nice efficient and fast  SAURBH helped me!\\nFast excellent service. Full clear explanation of operations, t&c, personally took me to storage locker to confirm that it was clean before taking over\\nVery easy to use. One thing though, you do need a printer because they won\\'t scan on the phone. Other than that, great savings, and very easy process to order and check out.\\nI received my boxwoods and they looked good.  Got them planted and followed the directions and it has been a week and they appear to be growing fine.   They were smaller than I thought they would be but I\\'m hoping they will take hold and grow quickly.\\nExcellent service and beautiful products.  Hard to find Cavalier King Charles Spaniel items, but this site has tons of beautiful items of this breed.  They two throws I ordered are very large, printed on both sides and nice fabric.  The pillow is really well made, with a zipper so it can be washed without the inside pillow form.  Excellent products and fast shipping.  Can\\'t wait until my two car mats arrive with my Ruby Cavalier on them!\\nFloral arrangement was delivered on time and the recipient loved it!\\nI only discovered this calendar after I had retired.\\r\\n I use it every day to keep track of both my community committees and our family activities. The one thing I do like is that for each committee and or family activity I can colour coordinate the text colour to the group. I really like the \"email to myself\" option.\\r\\nI can see the value this calender would\\'ve had added if I was still working full-time. I\\'d have no problem justifying buying the complete program. I am very grateful that the free portion serves me so well.\\nI sent in 5 photos and they were all rejected until I received some detailed information about sending a digital photo.  It was frustrating\\nThis is a very professional company which delivers a great product with excellent value. I am looking forward with dealing with them again in the near future.\\nI bought a new Bvlgari watch for my wife at Jomashop. It\\'s brand new, except that the time was running way too fast for an automatic watch. It was running like 5 mins fast every hour. Given how unreliable the customer service is based on reviews and experience (online agent not very polite), I took it to a reputable local watch store for repair without even trying to communicate to Jomashop. The store claimed that the watch probably had an impact that caused the spring wheel to twist. It was a $100 fix, and fortunately, it\\'s not more than that. Given how cheap the watches and how unreliable customer service are at Jomashop, I believe it\\'s a good idea to buy watches from Jomashop but serviced somewhere else.\\nService and quality is awful!! This company is scam ran by crooks\\nMike was such a great help on answering my questions and helping me resolve some issues I had with my tshirts. He was very attentive and helpful. I needed my shirts fast and I received them on the date promised! I was very happy with that. I will definitely be ordering my shirts for next season from rush order tees and asking for mike!\\nExcellent Team\\nLike the progress,impressed\\nGood place to park for a good price.\\n\\nGood price. You can make a reservation online and they will make sure you get a spot. The shuttles come frequently. Employees are friendly.\\nNice company,very caring and helpful staff\\nDelivered on time to my daughter for her birthday. She loved it!\\nHorrible company. Impossible to reach. impossible to cancel. I ported my number to another company and they extorted fines and payments and called a debt collecter over $25. The service was canceled cause of constant beeps on phone during conversations. They could not fix my outgoing caller ID either. Avoid phone power at all cost.\\nI feel very safe in ordering on line and the service is very good. I am also comfortable with the prices, and speed of shipment. Very satisfied.\\nAlways on time, great quality food choices! Absolutely recommend pet flow to all pet owners!\\nMy experience has been great!\\nGay guy here.  Got the three site chlamydia and gonorrhea box.\\n\\nMy box had no instructions for the throat swab and no instructions for the rectal swab.  I did get instructions for a vaginal swab... \\n\\nFortunately, I\\'m a nurse and know how to swab.  Others might be a little lost.\\n\\nEverything else was perfect.\\nVery good service and fast answer for my tickets\\nEasy enough way to move large packages and luggage!\\nI wont exaggerate but Trustpilot is very trustworthy. \\r\\nI guess this is the best place if you want legit reviews coming from legit customers because Trustpilot takes a lot of consideration before approving your review.\\r\\n\\r\\nThumbs up to Trustpilot. Please continue the goodness that you are doing :)\\nI have made a few reservations using JustFly and the price was always better than the airlines website. In one instance, I had to cancel the reservation as well which was easy enough.\\nQuick, Easy and Convenient. Plus o loft that the repayment ia done with my card on the day its due so its taken out immediately.\\nhad what i needed\\nMy experience with Cheap-o-air so far has been has been satisfactory,  I am hoping the Provider that will provide the type of car I have requested will come thru with an Chev. Impala or an American car.  Hope I can use your company again in the near future.\\nConvenient, reliable, safe.\\nExactly what we wanted for our wedding and got them quick!\\nPurchased the Mobal unlimited data sim card for my daughter to use on her trip to Amsterdam and it worked perfectly.  Great purchase. Thank you Mobal\\nThe best experience ever. Its simple and easy not to mention the low price.\\ngreat company, great service and easy to navigate the site\\nMy business website was down and since I take orders through my site I can\\'t afford to have it down for long.  Go Daddy customer support was helpful in finding the problem and getting it back up and running quickly.\\nThe ordering and shipping process was great (fast delivery) but the product quality wasn\\'t the greatest. I could not even read part of the design on the onesie.\\nI order 3 mugs for my daughter for Christmas. The shipping was very fast, and Cafepress emailed me to let me know exactly when the order had shipped, along with  the tracking number.  The mugs are adorable and very well made. I\\'m sure that I will be back for more!\\nHappy with the available options. Chose a good one. Would recommend Home Advisors to anyone.\\nI dislike traveling since 9/11 but I have to say...my first experience with Long Term Parking made my last trip at least tolerable.  I opted for the Valet parking option and am so glad I did.  I arrived at the lot (easy to find BTW), pulled my car into valet lane, checked-in at the desk and was on the shuttle to the airport in about 5-mins.  I was dropped off at my departure terminal a few mins later and on my way.  Upon getting back, I used the instructions provided to text LTP that I had arrived and was waiting at Terminal A.  Sure enough...a few minutes later, the shuttle arrived to take me back to my car where it was ready and waiting for me.  Another quick check-in/payment at the desk and I was on my way.  Never again will I use the Airport\\'s parking as LTP provides much better service much less cost.\\nI would like to thank the staff of this facility, they were very friendly and answered all of my questions.  My move in and move out were a very good experience and I would recommend this company to anyone in need of a storage facility.\\nExcellent service. Easy to order and, though shipping a bit costly, I understood why when box arrived. Every single item was carefully wrapped and packed. Nothing broken nor damaged.\\nAs for the items themselves, attractive packaging--make wonderful gifts.\\nI make several purchases from Afloral per week. This 3 star rating is for the real touch peony bouquet I purchased. 3 tiny flowers and one tiny bud for $20.00 plus shipping - these flowers are terrible. Very unpleased with that particular purchase.\\n\\nI would rate my other purchases with 4 to 5 stars.\\nUPS was a day late in delivering. The next day when they delivered it was left on the porch at the wrong address, luckily those ppl knew where it was supposed to go. When my recipients finally got the cake, it was smashed & melted! I\\'m very upset!! Almost $70 spent & im totally embarrassed at what my friends received!!\\nVery good service\\nI am so disappointed- never again ZARA ! Was on holiday in Glasgow- I bought a dress , and it broke after 1 time wearing it. Called Zara, and got an unusable answer- that I had to return it in Glasgow again - IWASV ON HOLIDAY; FOR GOD SAKE ! I asked whether I could send it then - BUT NO , I had to return it physically- this is very bad customer service- if you can call this service.\\nCheapest ticket online!\\nI love my new compression gloves. They lessen the arthritis pain.\\nGreat service. Cards looked great and arrived fast.\\nWe really appreciate getting AMC gift cards for a discounted price.  Movie tickets & movie popcorn these days are expensive, so GiftCardRescue is very much appreciated.  Easy ordering process & prompt delivery of the gift cards.  It\\'s wonderful!\\nTruly one of the worst companies on the internet...customer service is customer disservice...their coupons are typically of the bait and switch nature....preferred shipping, for which the consumer pays more, is anything but...STAY AWAY!\\nI had never heard of Wallet Hub until today. Upon using the search tool I decided to search the first credit union I was ever a member of. The search tool worked very quickly and very accurately. I was rather surprised at the speed. The tool provided the exact result I was looking for immediately. I did not even have to type in the full name of the credit union. The result I was looking for was also the top hit in the search results. Overall, this search tool works incredibly well.\\nAlways a good experience with selection and delivery 👍\\nI love UAE exchange all the staff are very polite anf accomodating and very good exchange rate\\nGreat job. Would use again.\\nThankful for your service, it is quick and efficient.\\nI have been using Pet Best for several months now since they have my dog food for $20 less a bag than my local pet food store with free shipping.  I have only had one hiccup in my order which was fixed promptly and they included a free bag of dog treats :)\\nThis was my first purchase from lenskart. I had doubt about the quality of the product. But the product I received is beyond my thoughts. It is too good. I will surely buy again from lenskart.\\nI made a purchase, gave my phone number and I wasn’t in the system.\\nVery good service and on time .And product is as described.\\nA good assistence and so quickly but I don\\'t like the payment.\\nI was a little concerned about our rental arrangements but I needn\\'t have been , rentalcars were brilliant I always use them .   We collected in Miami and dropped off in new York without a hitch.......\\nTwice I have placed orders for gifts for my wife. Both times the clothing in the orders was shipped at different times. No big deal. But, both times I received emails stating one item had shipped and 8-10 days later a different item arrived without any notice. Most recently I  ordered two pairs of pants and some boots. Three weeks ago I got an email stating one pair of pants was shipped and the other ones and boots would d ship later. Two weeks ago got an email saying boots had shipped but it could take 8 working days to arrive. 10 working days later, no boots, but the other pants arrived, again without notice\\nReceived a broken diecast car...contacted the seller, never heard anything from him...Disappointed!\\nThe service personell did not tell us if we should pay toll at the roads or not.\\n\\nWe missed that information in advence.\\nWow...shipped very fast. The book was in good condition and I saved so much money on the books I need for my classes.\\nThis is the second year in a row I have ordered my fundraiser tickets through them. They are so efficient and work really well with you to make sure it\\'s exact product you want. I will use them for all my ticket ordering in the future\\nTransaction went smooth\\nI have ordered multiple times from onnit and I was always extremely happy with every step to get my products. The shipping was quick and when my product was held at customs (1 time), customer service resolved the situation to my satisfaction... I will definitely be ordering again\\nProduct shipped in excellent condition--takes a little longer than I\\'d like sometimes, but really appreciate how the company takes care of my business--will continue to use them--free shipping is the deal!\\nMy experience with TRT Banners was great! My order was last-minute and they were able to get it done and send it to me on time. My only reservation was that they recommended regular shipping, knowing that I absolutely had to have the banner on a particular day, and if it had arrived late it would have been a disaster for me. But, adding on the cost of 2-day shipping still made it affordable!\\nWonderful price. Fast shipment. Hope to do business with you again soon.\\nI was looking for a last minutes flight to visit my parents and was shopping around. JustFly had the best prices and schedules for flights I was looking for.\\nI had a great experience, I was approved fast and everything worked out just fine.\\nParadise Farm and Tack was very easy to deal with and always responded to emails promptly.\\nI read some very negative reviews about Thrifty. Contrary to those reviews my experience was the best. When I arrived at Ben Gurion airport, I was proceeded immediately at the rental desk and only had to walk across a pedestrian overpass to the parking lot to fetch the car. The Mitsubishi Lancer was waiting for me and I was able to take off in minutes. My return was at 2AM. The agent checked out the car and gave me a receipt and had my van ready to take me to the terminal. The price was great, the car was very responsive and gas efficient. After 5 days of use I only had to fill a half a tank. My best car rental experience yet!\\nIt was easy to find what I was looking for on the website. They didn\\'t overcharge on shipping and it arrived before the date I was expecting it.\\nVery good to work with\\nI have purchased two of these urns. They are well constructed. I recommend them.\\nI chose a level 100-110 level boost and then contact me a week after I made the purchase. They said it is bank problem but I don\\'t actually know. I got to 110 myself by the time they contact me. So they helped me to switch my order to +15 key boost. I chose lower karazhan for mythic score. The run is fine, I went on there as healer rather than dd so they look for a dd in grp finder. Tank did make some mistakes. The Mage gave good dps but not all of them. (At least from my point of view. I\\'m a 935 H priest with 1900+ Mythic score). Team would be a better boost grp with cr. (at least for my point). The dungeon with this week affix is quite tricky. Not very happy coz we didn\\'t finish in time. There can be more improvement. To me it doesn\\'t worth the amount of money I spent but it differ from ppl. So choose wisely.\\nI ordered a pillow and I was very satisfied that the company kept me informed about my order, they got it to me quickly, and the pillow was high quality/ exactly what I ordered.\\nMy dissertation would not have been completed so fast if it were not for this service.  Revisions were great and did not detract from the overall intended meanings.  Excellent and fast work!  I will use them again for any important documents!\\nThis process could not have been easier, it took about 3 hours total over a period of two days to have everything complete. I recommend having all of your bills and statements ready to go before you call to make the process easier for you.\\n\\nThe representative that helped me, Josh, was so kind and friendly throughout the entire process. When he said he would call me back, he did. When he said he would email me something, he did. I was so impressed with the level of customer service I received. \\n\\nAdditionally, I was contacted by Jim a few days later to welcome me to the program. He was also very friendly and helpful.\\n\\nTo sum it up, the representatives do a great job of making what could be a very difficult process smooth, easy and with as little stress as possible.\\nThe only reason I am giving one.com 1 star is because technically I can\\'t give them a 0 star.\\r\\nFirst, on the main page of their site they loudly claim\\r\\n\\r\\n\"No strings attached!\\r\\n\\r\\nYou are free to cancel your subscription anytime, should you wish to do so.\\r\\nAfter the first FREE year, your price for the web hosting package is only 1.45 USD /month\"\\r\\n\\r\\nBut then they deceive you with their it was mentioned in the terms and conditions and make you realize that the tagline should have been rather been \"several strings attached\".\\r\\n\\r\\n1. One.com expects you to manually Cancel your subscription 1 month before the expiry of your hosting plan by contacting their customer care, otherwise you are auto renewed and charged for the subsequent year. Unlike other well known hosting providers who cancel the hosting plan by default on non payment of renewal fee(unless the customer decides to go for auto renewal), One.com forces auto renewal on all it\\'s customers. As of reminders about the expiry of hosting plan, while others send atleast 5 to 6 reminders, One.com sends only 1 reminder, having missed which you are bound to be auto renewed. The Customer care is prompt enough to show the terms & condition to the customers.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. After the expiry of due date(15 days before the expiry of the Hosting Plan), one.com expects you to Pay an extra 12$ as a reminder fees every time they send you a mail reminding you to pay your due amount. So expect a bill of somewhere around 12$ every month as reminder fees, in case you fail to pay renewal fees for a website that was forcibly renewed without your consent. The customer care have their usual excuse \"Please read the terms & conditions\"\\r\\n\\r\\n3. The web hosting package for which you are supposed to pay $1.45 every month after expiry, apparently doesn\\'t include the domain name. For the domain you are supposed to pay an additional $13.8/yr, thus making the grand total of $31.2/yr. Inspite of the fact that the web hosting package you bought actually contains a domain and One.com itself claims in it\\'s main page \\r\\n\"Web hosting - everything included\\r\\n5 GB Hosting space\\r\\nDomain\\r\\nFREE Website tools\\r\\nUnlimited transfer\\r\\nUnlimited email accounts\\r\\nCloud Drive\"\\r\\n\\r\\n4. One.com\\'s Customer Care is perhaps one of the worst in the industry and for everything they have a single answer \"We have mentioned it in the terms and condition\".\\r\\n\\r\\nI made a huge mistake of disregarding the negative reviews about one.com and bought a web hosting plan trusting and expecting them to be customer friendly. Alas, I became a victim myself and now I am forced to write a review about them to warn others and let the company know that if they don\\'t change their policies and continue scamming people with their \"terms & conditions\" then sooner or later they would be forced to pull down their shutters.\\nLoved everything that I ordered!\\nfast delivery, good quality, good price!\\nI ordered a pair of KYB Gas Shocks and they were delivered quickly. Best price I could find anywhere and a discount coupon to boot. Can\\'t beat that!\\nEmail stated my order had been shipped over a week ago and I am still waiting.\\nvery accommodating and soft spoken staff.\\nVery helpful.\\nI highly recommend this site to everyone and definitely I will use them again in the future.\\n\\nThank you Delmo,\\nLynn\\nExcellent service\\nThe lamp part I ordered worked perfectly!\\nwebsite is friendly\\neasy to install and looks great\\nGood choices. Perfect execution. Good value\\nGreat service and fast admin service...\\nI am glad withe the service that Springer offers, I received my chapter of the book in a few days and I had not any problem. I recomend you whether you have any doubt.\\nSite was easy to navigate - it\\'s the first time I\\'ve used it...so far so good as I haven\\'t taken the flight yet : )\\nI own an Audi and the parts are ridiculously expensive.  I was able to get the parts I needed at a very reasonable price.  I would order from them again.\\nThey did an excellent job of arranging all the tour entrances and were very attentive and informative during the entire experience.\\nOrdering was easy, price/value very good. But product i received was either a floor sample or a returned product. It was dirty and did not have any manufacturers tags on it. Disappointed!\\nGot 2 sets of necklace converters (6 total pieces) and one piece is broken. Not worth it to return.\\nGreat customer service, prices are great also.\\nJust started my policy\\nReceived product in a timely manner and thanks.\\nI have been getting parts for a while now for my old 94 trooper. I haven\\'t been disappointed yet!\\nThis was a very meaningful way to memorialize someone who recently died.  The family was deeply touched by the gesture and loved the materials that came with the certificate.  I highly recommend the Star Name registry.\\nI spoke with Mr Patrick Wallace, the talk since the begining was not just friendly, was direct, clear answers, clear questions, not cutting corners, I told Patrick what I need , Patrick told me what he need it, and with that info, I got my proposal withing few hours. That is the way I like to do business. Good Job Mr Wallace. Thank you.\\nI would have given 5 stars but when wanting to place an order online I  can not charge to  my account. I always have to call it in.\\nWhat a wonderful experience topped off with more compliments received on flowers than any I have ever sent before. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM!\\nPlants are very nice size when sent.   They are also very healthy.  Sometimes they are very dry upon arrival and I receive them very quickly from the initial shipping date.  A few haven’t survived.:(\\nI really do reccomend this company to everyone doing online drivers learning ! it makes jokes and it has videos to lighten you up and it isnt just like a robot telling information it gives examples every teenager can relate to! they mention prom, texting and other things like that. If you wanna go the online or parent taught online course i highly suggest you choose aceable. It is worth your money and time.

Or you get an advanced readers copy which is never stated in the purchase, but other than that this site is solid and will continue to purchase books from here for a long time\\nBeen using for a few years now and they always have many options and good prices for airport parking. I would hope they could offer a little more in the way of discounts when booking like certain times during the year they will offer a good discount towards the purchase price..\\nrepresentative was terrific.  smart, attentive and thorough.  very professional.\\r\\ngive the girl a raise!!\\nEvery purchase adiquirido I have more confidence to buy more and am sure it will arrive. \\r\\nThanks for giving me that feeling\\nI was looking for quality and hoped that you\\'d be a bit higher quality than Omaha.

I love Remitly!\\nThe website is incredibly simple to navigate and the lettering tools allowed me to be creative with the marketing message I needed to represent. This is exactly what I have been looking for.\\nAt first I was quite happy to discover PartsGeek on-line to supply parts for my total re-build of a 1993 Eurovan.  Their web site was easy to use and to find the parts I needed so I ordered a large number of parts.  Unfortunately, the first time I had a question about a certain part I was only able to contact this group on-line and even though I tried several times my question was never directly answered.  Next, one of the parts I received - one of two tie rod ends - did not fit because the inner threads had not been cut correctly.  It was obviously a manufacturer\\'s problem but again, I could only contact PartsGeek via the web and was not able to talk with someone directly about the problem.  Even the phone number given on the web site resulted in a recorded message telling me to  contact them through the web.  I applied for a \"return item\" number and wrote an explanation of the problem but the process was treated as if I had ordered the wrong part and was my fault.  I had to pay the shipping costs to return the part and then was charged a re-stocking fee.  That was bad enough but I had a feeling that the information about the problem part would be lost and the part would be returned to the shelf and re-sold, causing the same problem for the next person.  This suspicion was confirmed when I was ready to install the water pump I bought from PartsGeek.  When I received the pump via UPS I had opened the box and took a quick look inside and the pump looked fine.   The part sat in the box while I worked on the engine.  When I finally took the part out I realized that it had been sold to someone before - there were bolt/washer pressure marks on the install holes - and been returned.  The problem was that the pump had been returned with the first buyer\\'s used, rusty and brittle O-ring and no one at PartsGeek bothered to notice.\\r\\nMy bad experiences would not have happened if  PartsGeek had an effective Customer Service department where a customer can contact a real, live person on the phone an discuss and resolve problems.  Until PartsGeek does this I will not buy parts from them and will caution others to do the same.\\nVery courteous and quick to ship!\\nTitle says it.\\nWorks great in my Fridge\\nI found it...cheap, very accurate according to departing and arriving times.\\nEasy and fast\\nI got 15 games for $8.

The woman in the videos is so redundant, often saying the same thing three different ways in a matter of minutes. The videos make mention of terminology that is never spelled or is not even a vocabulary word, which I find ridiculous.  This is an anatomy class and if you are going to talk about it don\\'t assume the learner knows anything about what it is that you are saying. The book is not helpful at all. At the end of the chapter there are vocabulary words and next to them pages where the word was discussed. Well when you go to that page you simply find the word with a line next to it where a definition is to be inserted. Basically, they never define the word.\\n\\nI am highly disappointed and find it hard to even get motivated to work through this program. It is torturous to me.\\nreliable with prompt delivery\\nThe website is easy to maneuver and I was able to use my phone to verify reservations.\\nJust purchased, hoping that it will come soon for me to enjoy\\nI have been ordering from these people since just about the get-go. I think they were two years old when I found them. I need a northern supplier-other suppliers just don\\'t know our challenges. They have replaced seed that didn\\'t germinate(very likely NOT their fault), dug up some seed for me that was not in the current catalogue, given me advice on phone, answered question patiently, orders come on time, I trust their testing processes. and all in all, I love this company, the staff and comfort of ordering from friends.\\nGreat product and costumer service\\nAllison was very helpful. It would have been much more difficult without her.\\nVery nice, product exactly as expected, quick service\\nVery good service. One item did not fit & needed to exchange.  However, we had a trip coming up & normally would not have received the correct size in time since it was back-ordered.  Your customer service was great in that they rush shipped the right size at no extra cost when it arrived.  I received it in time for our trip!  Clothing fits very well being a tall woman.\\nThis was a copper plaque to be attached to a bench in memory of my late husband.  Works very well and appears sturdy an weather resistant\\nI applied online and it only took a few minutes to inform me if I was approved or not and how much I was approved for.

I highly recommend rocket loans to anyone that needs a loan quickly.\\nShirt looks cheap. Color I ordered did not come. I will be returning the shirt\\nI am a visitor to USA. Most travel related websites in USA drive me to frustration. Justfly is the easiest to use, fast, simple to follow, allows you to look at options, to change your request easily. It remembers your previous visits, and you can ask for alerts of deals. Payment process was fast and easy to use too :-)\\nAvant credit provided my business loan with the easiest execution I have ever experienced.

However, it was NOT easy to find the right contact number to ring.\\nMy experience with UnlimitedGb has been nothing but great. I needed a reliable and affordable hosting service to help with my profile site. After researching various options, it became obvious to me UnlimitedGb was what I needed. Their system is easy to use and for a non-technical type, that is very important.\\r\\n     I would and have been recommending UnlimitedGb to anyone who wants to listen. I will not hesitate to continue to do so in the future. They have a plan type that should suit any budget and knowledge level.\\nFound a book from my childhood!

Would recommend.\\nRequesting a essay type survey is a waste of my time!\\nI love colors, pattern and quality of fabric.\\nWhile the daily rates were cheaper than most in the area, I would NOT recommend going to this location if you have anything of value left in your vehicle.  I had personal belongings in my vehicle (hidden in my center console), and they were not in my vehicle upon my return.  It says a lot about a company when their employees need to steal from their customers.  I will gladly pay full price at the airport next time to know my vehicle and it\\'s belongings are safe from theft.  The shuttle driver was very nice - that was the only positive from this whole experience.\\nThis site offered the most money for my phone. The whole process was as simple as possible.

Christmas Eve myself and a couple of family elves were preparing for Santa for the little ones, my Grands who were quietly sleeping finally!!!, infortunely, all were awaken, startled in fact by an alarming siren noise...we search all over the home dismantling smoke detectors, on all three floors, noise getting louder n louder, I called Viviant spoke w a rep who could also hear the blaring noise over the phone....I was directed to disconnect the detector near my door, and to no avail, hung up I satisfied.   The noise has stopped to date, however there is some “horn” sound that happens at least every 3-4 hours a day,.  I called again more recently thought the agent helped with this new noise, and No once again...the horn noise continues, and we are just living it because no one seems to know how to solve the problem.  It’s to the point that even my Grands who complained, are immune to it!!! \\nI was gladfyi get this survey, because I would like someone to investigate into this matter.\\nRobyn Waller\\nI found the site was great and easy to use.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll the options available made it easy to create the perfect suit.\\r\\n\\r\\nI was worried about how it would turn out doing the measurements online, but the videos/guides online made it so simple.\\nDrop off was quick and right by the entrance.\\nQuick transfer to a bus and short trip to a terminal.\\nFinding parking lot was a little tricky.

Having someone in your corner you feel that you can trust can help in the decision making process, and allows you to breathe a sigh relief.  I think Raphael needs a raise because I am a tough cookie, and I look for the negative before I can see the positive.  Thank you Raphael, your assistance really meant a lot to me.\\nbooked a flight, realized straight after that you can\\'t use special characters, so a guy cancelled it for me and straight after i booked another flight correctly. The next day i found out the guy cancelled the wrong reservation. i spoke with \"Sarah\" who tried charging me an extra $50 per ticket. It was probably thee worst experience I\\'ve ever had with a customer service representative. She raised her voice and told me it was my fault. I realized i was not getting anywhere with her and asked to speak to her supervisor. She came back 10 mins later and told me she would do this one time for me. like if she was doing me the favor. All and all i still asked to speak with  higher authority and again gave me attitude about that. \\n\\nEvery other team member i spoke with was nice and friendly and gave me no issues!\\n\\nWell that was my experience.\\nI found this company via Facebook advertising and overall am happy. I really like the blog posts and emails that come through with tips, recipes, and exercises. \\n\\nI love the protein bars and have ordered them a couple of times because I love them so much, but this time the entire box was completely melted and total mush. When you pay $12 for bars, this kind of stinks. They were edible, but not great by any means. \\n\\nI liked the BCAA drink mix, but it upset my stomach too much too order it again. It tasted great, but it gave me a stomach ache. Perhaps I wasn\\'t hydrating enough though to compensate for the ingredients. I have t reordered it because of this. \\n\\nI just tried the mixed pack of drink mixes that are for weight loss, energy and craving reductions and honestly, they taste so awful that I can never make it through a full glass of the mix. I think the energy is nice, but I wish they could make it taste better the way their other products taste so awesome.\\nGreat buyback program.\\nA bright and colourful home screen, easy to use menus and a fast service.

I have been ordering them for several years now and hope to do so in the future!\\nAccidentally ordered the wrong fridge.  Called them up and they took care of it.  It was great to be able to order, then pick up the next day, when most other places took a week.\\nQuick shipping and good assortment of products for Bariatric patients.\\nHigh quality and on timie.\\nI called, asking if they carried a particular brand/model of tire that I had used in the past. They informed me they in fact DID carry it. The salesperson on the phone, (J.P.), asked if I would mind telling him why I chose this brand of tire. I filled him in on the details, and he again asked if I would mind if he could suggest another tire brand. I informed him I didn\\'t mind, and he suggested Nexen tires. I told him I had never heard of them and he qualified his suggestion with a wide array of facts on this tire brand. I was impressed with his knowledge and told him I would take a chance and purchase the tires he suggested. He told me I had 30 days to make my mind up but was sure I would love them. I told J.P. I would be back in a couple of hours to pick the car up. Fifty-seven minutes later, I got a text informing me my car was ready! Four-wheel alignment included. When I picked my car up, J.P. was busy, so I didn\\'t have the chance to thank him and tell him I was impressed with the timing and service. After driving less than 1/8th mile, I was sold. These tires were MUCH more plush than my former tires. The service & price sold me on Town Fair tire. The quality and performance of the tire was the icing on the cake.\\nI just love that when I got back from my trip, long term was waiting for me at the terminal, and my car was ready with the car truck waiting to put my bags in when i got back to the parking spot.\\n????????????????\\nGenerally clean, but needs remodel.  Tub was cracked and we could see they tried to patch it.  Furniture in the room was low quality.

As well, it is hard to find an online authorized dealer for Swiss watches...so this is an opportunity to get high quality watches without the hassle and inflated markups of your regular dealers and jewellers. I would buy product from this dealer again and will recommend them to family and friends.\\nthe best VPN service I love it just amazing\\nExcellent service, excellent location.\\nVery musty smelling. Had to clean off all furniture inside and out because of mildew.  Had to wash all bedding and towels before using because of mildew. The pillows were so old, lumpy and stained....gross. Both shower heads were soooo corroded there was O water pressure.  SOOO disappointed and feel ripped-off.\\nThis store has got the WORST customer service. Never in my life have I     been treated in a store so rudely. I had someone bringing me a pair of boots and since they work on commission no one else was able to help me with another pair. That first guy was nowhere to be seen, and finally he came I was holding a few more styles that I wanted to try and he was like those are not available in your size. Those are the last pairs, and he was gone without even looking at them. So I proceeded to try on the floor sample boots which were my size actually, and then another guy (or maybe it was the same) came and grabbed all the boots away. You can\\'t try on floor sample boots. \\r\\n\\r\\nI settled on two boots that I wanted and tried again to ask anybody else to bring me the boots and to even just tell me the price. Nobody wanted to help me. Finally the original rude salesman came back, and he said he will bring it for me. He brought me only one, and he was gone. I tried again to locate him, and finally I did. I asked where is the other one. He said you can only try on one at a time. I am like: HU? I want to compare them!!! He said he will lose his job, if I want to try on another one together. So I asked him to speak to the manager. He said she should be around here. So I said can you please show me where. He said I can\\'t call her. I asked again and this time he said she\\'s on lunch. I said you don\\'t start that with me, so he said oh there she is. She was standing right in back of me the entire time. RUDEST, NASTIEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!\\nLess than 4 days to unlock my iPhone 5 from Vodafone. Brilliant service and very reasonable.\\nHe Was GREAT and Very Helpful!\\nI use Economy Car Rentals twice a year when i go to Cyprus. Good price and never a problem - would not change. Another reason i like them is that when i pick the car up there is usually a full tank of petrol. When i take it back i just have to make sure it has the same amount of petrol in as when i picked it up. Other car rental companies give you the car and charge you for the petrol in the car on receipt (not the same price as the current cost of petrol) and then when you take it back you either drive back on fumes or leave them with extra petrol you have put in and it costs you both times - on top of the car rental itself\\nI created a class on history and technology and was able to find all of my text resources using Thrift Books. As a school teacher most of my resources are straight out of pocket and it was great to be able to track down just what I needed while saving a bundle over the cost of new. My students love the DK Technology and Invention books and we all send a big thank you!\\nMy husband surprised me with a last minute ( like 4 days ahead), Mother\\'s Day getaway.

I would use Norman again.\\nNice and quick, thanks!\\nThe evaluator of a claim categorized my claim as travel delay.  This category does not return the full amount for my excursion loss.  Though I discussed this extensively with the evaluator as placing my claim in the wrong category, he would not budge.  When I told him that others in the same position on the same cruise got full payment and gave him full details, he finally relented.  This was unnecessary.\\n\\nReaching the evaluator was also trying since the number he gave would not reach a living person.  Took many iterations.\\nGood selection, good prices, fast processing\\nI ordered and payed a computerbattery from usbphoneworld, but they send a wrong battery. They acknowledged the fault and promised to deliver a new one, Now 6 months later we still have not received our battery. \\r\\ntheir support team is very friendly and keep saying they will look into the matter, but the result still is no delivery. We have lost more than a 100 dollars dealing with this firm.\\nWouldn\\'t buy bags from here again ! Bags didn\\'t fit my bike I\\'m in the military so I\\'m moving duty station to Greece and they refused to return my bags since I couldn\\'t take pictures of installment with them on my bike . Worst company to buy from .\\nGoogle as a search engine is quite good, but Adwords is really bad and very expensive. I paid 3$ for every visitor on my website and it was a waste of money. Almost every other ad service I used provided better returns.\\nGreat phone service\\nEasy ordering process, products delivered quickly. Happy with the quality of what we received.  Basically a problem free experience, I recommend them.\\nThis course was very helpful to take. I loved it.\\nI ordered a Gibbs Rules mug (2032996089) and I was disappointed that the rules are not readable even with magnification. The font is just blurry.\\nHOT AND SPICY\\nChatted with David who made paying off my loan quick and easy.\\nAwesome service, pricing was excellent, quick delivery. I will most certainly do business again.\\nYOUR SERVICE IS SATISFACTORY. BUT THE AIRLINE THAT YOU BOOK GETS ONLY A ONE STAR.I SAY THIS BECAUSE THE AIRLINE THAT I WAS BOOKED ON DOES NOT GIVE YOU A OPPORTUNITY TO PICK YOUR SEATS. THE NON-STOP FLT. 6209 TO GATWICK AND 6211 WILL HAVE THE SAME OPTION, THE SEATS WILL NOT OPEN UNTIL ONE OR TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FLIGHT. THAT IS WHAT I WAS TOLD BY 1800FLYEUROPE NOW. NO AIRLINE THAT I KNOW HAS THESE RESTRICTIONS. WHO IS TO BLAME FOR THIS RESTRICTION. I AM BOOKED ON AMERICAN AIRLINES, BUT THE FLT. IS FLOWN BY BRITISH AIRLINES. I WAS TOLD IT WAS THE BRITISH AIRLINES THAT MADE THAT CALL.\\nThe staff was also five star!!  This is a wonderful destination for those who value not only the latest in tech i.e. window coverings, studios facing north, real desert plants maintained outside each and every residence,  floor plans that bring the outside in, not to mention, once again, five star amenities in bath, kitchen and laundry.  The ease of passing your trash from your floor location, to full mail service, to secure covered garage space, to extra storage available is so well thought out by developer.  Now I did not even get into topside pool plus amenities, nor fitness to any degree, whether it be your own personal trainer or yoga inside or outside on the grass.  Now the only thing left is food.  You can walk to a grand food lovers dream of everything from Mastros Ocean Club  to N.Italiano to Sheck Shack hot dogs r us, to the very special atmosphere extraordinaire Eddie Vs.  How could you not love this most beautiful place on earth.  My gift is an easy smile, and I am smiling all day long.\\nI had a very pleasant experience working with Elliot Dydo, Senior Portfolio Manager at Bankers Healthcare Group.  Elliot was very informative and took time to understand our business needs. Elliot responded fully and promptly to our inquiries and questions and ensured that the loan process was very fast and thorough. I would highly recommend Elliot to colleagues for their commercial loan needs.\\nDelivery was quick.  Product was well packaged to avoid damage in shipment.

Glad I was able to find it and shipped in 3 days :)\\nGreat website and wonderful caring people are out there to take care of your dog. I recommend Rover.com!\\nI had 4 sets of the personalized postcards made at $10.99 for each set.  They are all too dark to use.  Such a waste of money.  Will never use this company again unless they make it right.\\nSample packs from different libraries at one place.\\nMany of them give you a small demo.\\nQuick buy and download.\\nGot the key almost instantly, redeemed without problem on Steam.\\nI HIGHLY recommend using Ace Cash Express. There is NEVER a problem.\\nGreat equipment.\\nThere is no mercury in the tuna.\\nAfter visiting Italy, I thought I would never find excellent olive oil and balsamic vinegar like I tasted there. After doing some research, I found this site and decided to order some of their products. They did not disappoint. Excellent quality! Will never buy my stuff from the local store again. Olive Oil Lovers has won my business!\\nExcellent, definitely set my truck off👌\\nGreat deal also.\\nWe have booked with priceline numerous times and have never been disappointed - as long as you pay attention to the reviews - we never book anything with less than a 7+ customer review, no matter what the \"star\" rating says.\\nYou asked for honest.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ve parked at the Premium garage for 4 years now, averaging 40 weeks per year. The garage location is phenomenal and convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that said:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. I\\'ve walked to the garage one 4 occasions when flying into Seattle after 7PM because the shuttle takes too long (15+ minutes).\\r\\n2. I prefer scanning my membership card to leave; for the last 2 months the machine has been charging me $3,491 dollars. Each time the attendant has needed to take my payment rather than me using the machine. My question is why the machine is still malfunctioning after 2 months when employees know of the problem?\\r\\n3. From time to time I\\'ve had to park in valet because the entire garage is full; driving to a separate, off-site, WallyPark is inconvenient once I\\'m at the Garage. I should not be given an attitude when asking for my normal pricing under those circumstances, but I am. Each time I\\'ve had to use free parking points to decrease my valet bill when the only reason I used valet was because the entire garage was full (including the roof where the card reader is inoperable). I\\'ve tried other garages, and if WallyPark employees can\\'t see past company policies in order to accommodate paying customers, then I will continue going elsewhere. \\r\\n4. I still haven\\'t heard a return phone call from the Garage General Manager after leaving a message over a year ago.\\r\\n4. Finally, only a small minority of the employees I\\'ve come across have been even close to friendly. I don\\'t have to use WallyPark; I would rather park in an uncovered lot further away and pay friendly, accommodating people than park at your nicer garage and deal with non-chalant attitudes and very poor customer service skills.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, I park in your garage roughly 40 weeks per year, 3 or 4 nights per week.\\nThe mug is beautiful and the colors are bright. It\\'ll make a great Father\\'s Day gift. Arrived early even! Thank you\\nJust ordered.

We had great service, from Rebecca Anderson for the planning of the trip to the service when we were in Costa Rica. The response time was always very short and we were able to book our trip in a record time. Also, everything went smoothly and according to plan during our trip.I recommend the agency for people who have a general idea of the things they wish to do, but doesn\\'t have the time or interest to speng hours organizing every last details for their trip.\\nWhen I was in Boston for school, I used to come here to buy puzzle spheres and other fun gifts for my girlfriend.  I\\'m back home in California now, but I\\'m glad I can still get them for her.  It was simple and delivered quick.  Thanks again guys.\\nFirst purchase from here, it won’t be my last.

I ordered a radiator for my Toyota truck and all was smooth. Although I couldn\\'t get the pay-pal link to work on my phone, I paid direct and the radiator came 4 days later. Very reasonably priced! Midas had quoted me $645 for this job. I bought it here for $120 and my husband installed it. Saved a ton of money!! Very pleased with this first experience and will definitely be a returning customer.\\nI can always find the perfect fit for my Audi and significantly below what the dealer would charge me. Shipping is usually fast and parts have never disapointed me.\\nArrived on time, as described and correctly lettered.  The magnetic type is ideal for the women\\'s uniform shirt.\\nAll good but didn\\'t receive any notifications about order, status, shipping until I emailed a week later and the shipment arrived the next day, just like to know if everything was in order\\nDude, \\r\\nthis sight is amazing!!! i was able to put a picture and everything on it.  you have you try it out!!!\\nThe product is high quality. The price is reasonable. And it shipped quickly. I am a satisfied customer.\\nOnline ordering was easy.  Delivery was timely.  Checks are exactly what I wanted\\nWe appreciate the detailed, close up photos of the gown we ordered.  It also made a real difference to be able to see the model\\'s stats, to be able to compare my daughter\\'s physique with the girl in the photo.  It made it easy to be able to determine which gowns would and would not work for my daughter.  We also liked the detailed measurements of the length of the gown. We hit a home run on the first try - the gown was perfect!\\nSpecs are good quality and the glasses are also good...\\nI was pleasantly surprised at how quick and easy it was to get the funding I needed to keep our power from getting turned off.  Thank you Avant!!!\\nMy wife and I rode from NYC to La Guardia to catch a late morning flight.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I am using Dial7 a lot, I got their spring coupon on the mail, and used it towards the reservation.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the driver asked for the coupon, I told him I got it online. I than asked if the coupon was implemented, and got a short and rude answer that it did. So far, not that bad.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, the entire process of the checkout was done by the driver. Usually (and I use Dial7 and Carmel A LOT!), the driver just swipes the card, and hands the device to the customer to review the bill, choose the tip amount and to sign. In this case, the driver verbally asked me how much tip I would like to add (made me feel uncomfortable) and just handed me the device to sign without an option to review the bill.\\r\\n\\r\\nI got the receipt immediately to my phone and looked at it, and saw that although the driver used EZ-Pass on the Triboro bridge (meaning, he paid $5.54), he charged me $8, which is the price if you go through the cash lanes, and therefore, over-charged me for $2.46.\\r\\n\\r\\nI asked him about it and he snapped at me, calling me cheap and said that all I want is a free ride. I can\\'t even describe the shock I was in to hear those insults, and I told the driver that these accusations are extremely rude, especially to someone who uses this service so many times a year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis wrongful charge should not be looked individually, because if the driver is over-charging everybody, it sums up to a huge amount of money.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope Dial7 will get back to me on this matter.\\nThriftbooks is already cheap, and I often find discounts I can use in addition to the low prices. I also love the rewards program, and especially the free shipping for orders over $10! I can\\'t always find new textbooks on the website, but it is great for literature or when I can use older textbook versions.\\nMy custom tees came quickly, on time & look great. I decided on a Sunday afternoon to order for a charity football game my husband was playing in. I had them for his team that following Friday. I will definitely use this company again. And again. Thank u!\\nBest prices around by far! They always ship in a timely manner. No complaints!\\nPerfect service everything went great could not have asked for more. Loved the email and phone updates with delivery times.\\nReal, new, working parts. I was hesitant but its all legit and cheaper than the auto stores here.\\nGreat Company with excellent products at a reasonable price.\\nthank you very much\\nMy plants arrived a bit dry this time, and more disturbing, the soil was gone from around the roots on some plants where the corrugated board was not covering the top. Five of six plants look pretty good, the one with the least soil around the roots looks iffy. It must have been a hastily done job. This is out of the ordinary for Bluestone. Usually the plants are adequately moist and the corrugated container is snug around the top of the pot.\\nRecently purchased some vent replacement Flaps, was WOW\\'d When they arrived in 2 days!!  In time to be installed before our Trip. \\r\\n\\r\\nAwesome Service !!\\nVery pleased\\nI am able to buy so many books for myself, daughter, friends, and family.  I would say that 1 out of 50 books may be a little worse for wear, and those are usually one of the toddler books I am getting. All of the books for adults are in absolutely solid shape.  The way I have been able to grow my library for such low costs is incredible.\\nCourse very well presented and covered material / topics thoroughly. Will recommend to others.\\nQuick shipping , great prices , great knowledge  base\\nLots of great prices on the cars. Everyone was nice and very patient throughout the process even though I kept them there 45 minutes after closing.  Great looking facility overall.\\nThank you! Great experience\\nI LOVE THIS APP!

I sugest it for everyone!\\nClaim paid fast, work as advertised\\nI like everything about this site, to be able to put multiple items in one shipment is awesome for me seeing I life in Hawaii and shipping can get a bit costly.\\nEasy to use, navigate and book through.  Also, I got a great rate that was not available on comparable sites.  VERY pleased!!!\\nStaff is always very helpful and courteous.\\nMy driver did a great job helping me find his car at La Guardia in heavy traffic, in construction (is every airport in the world always under construction?!) and in the dark!  The dispatcher had not given specific directions of which door to use to find the driver (but I had asked, so she should have!) so he really helped a lot.\\nExcellent service\\nVery good quality and selection of items. One can tell the Catholic store is spiritually motivated!\\nThe tarp was very thin. Will be surprised if it lasts us one winter season.  Three of the water bags would not hold water!\\nAs a new consumer, I am still wet behind the ears when it comes to rating Trustpilot. I will be better able after using the service in a few months time.

Very pleased with the tabletop card display rack. Easy to put together.\\nMy experience with Parts Geek was horrible.  It is inexcusable for a customer to be treated the way I was.  The money lost was trivial, and it is hard to believe any company could be so unreasonable..\\nGreat price and web-site selections, Richard\\ni like there form of help and products\\nBrilliant service and product\\nI will be refering all my friends to Carchex. Thank you\\nGreat service and helpful staff at the pick up point. 5 starsservice all the way, thanks.\\nI ordered the Dovo bergischer Lowe razor. All of the images showed a razor with variances in the scales, a mix of black cream and white. There were other razors that cost a lot less by Dovo with all white scales but I didn\\'t want those and was willing to spend the extra (almost double) cost to get the really nice one. Much to my surprise what arrived in the mail was an all white scaled razor. What a let down! When I called the rep told me they don\\'t know what is being sent out (?) they just get them from Dovo and ship them to the customer. Well if  your going to sell something to someone maybe you should know what it is your selling? Hope to get this straightened out.\\nI\\'ve been dealing with a few companies for my husbands supplies and NorthShore has been the best by far!\\n(see title for details)\\nThe products that are sent are as advertised and at a good price. My problem is that Pure Formulas lists products as available for months when they are not able. I have ordered a particular product from the website on numerous occasions only to have the order cancelled. I would expect the website to be updated to indicate that the product is out of stock or no longer available. The product I need has not been available for months and I keep trying to order it as it is still listed on the website as available.\\nThis was my first time ordering from cafepress. My products were delivered promptly and I received email updates (shipping day and expected delivery day) prior to arrival. I will order from Cafepress again.\\nMy cousin and I thoroughly enjoyed our time on the tour.  The recordings were informative and priceless tidbits of information presented in an engaging way.  The buses are clean and modern and easy to get on & off.  The bus drivers were all very knowledgeable and all were extremely patient and friendly.  And (just in case you don\\'t want to get off) the buses all slow down or stop at ideal times to get the BEST pics of awe-inspiring pieces of American history!  The best $30 I could have spent!!\\nShipping and pricing are excellent. Customer service by phone for me was poor.\\nGreat prices and all books received in greater than expected condition\\nCould do better in a couple of areas. One being PayPal should be offered to international members and the second is a currency converter which they had a one time which I really liked . Lets you know exactly what you will be paying if you do not live in the US.\\nI lové the experience And the money save 10 out of 10\\nGreat software and support\\nBiovea has excellent products and prices. I was very impressed with the customer service and I will definitely be shopping with them again. Two thumbs up for Biovea!\\nJeff, the technician that came to my house, was personable and well versed in the alarm system.\\n I have bad eyesight, and the touch screen is easy for me to find and operate.\\n I am more pleased than punch with this new system compared to the other company I had.\\nTerrible. Only interested in selling you a caravan, then when they have done they squeeze thousands a year out of you and are happy if you want to leave because then they get your caravan back for a small % of what you paid eg I paid £18k and got £1k BACK !  Salesmen will hassle you on your holiday + the toilets usually stink along with the carpets in the main rooms.\\nGreat rental\\nTwo times this month I have made purchases using the North Shore Commercial Door Company Inc.  There online site was easy to use and the items I needed were readily available and reasonably priced.  I made the orders and received them within a few business days.

I will definitely be ordering more products in the future.\\nThe person went out of their way to help me on the phone the only reason they are getting 5 stars. is a few things that they promised didn\\'t come through on my order.

Would definitely recommend BIOVEA\\nThe ordering process was great, however, I never received the part.\\nMy sales rep Jeff is very helpful and knowledgeable.

What more can you ask for?\\nBrian from Connecticut came to my home to install my new system and to my pleasant surprise he arrived early and I didn\\'t have to sit around waiting.  Brian was very professional and personable.  He communicated with me throughout the process so I understood what was what.  I sat without hesitation that Brian is truly an asset to Alliance.\\nI have been very satisfied with the company, product, and shipping associated with all my orders.  I sincerely hope the food that I\\'ve ordered is never used in my lifetime; that my reason for ordering never materializes.  But, even though I\\'m hoping for the best, I\\'m trying to prepare, as best I can, for the worst.  I\\'m buying \"insurance,\" in the hope I will never need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, I\\'m 100 percent sure, the food ordered will not be wasted, as my kids and grandkids will be able to use the extra cushion... I will be ordering more as time and money are available.\\nMore later will be write\\r\\nThanks\\nSparefoot is a good website that will find you the best rates for storage rental!\\nReservation was quick, easy, and affordable.  Parking was easy to find, van was on time, all went well.\\ni love this site it give me something to do and earn free money.\\nExcellent service. Fast shipment. Will purchase from again.\\nI never thought doing everything online would go so smoothly. I couldn\\'t imagine going through the process without any face to face meetings. I could not have been more wrong. The process was smooth. I went from start to finish in less than a month. Jeff Koontz from Busey bank deserves all the credit. He is awesome. Look him up and you won\\'t regret it.\\nI will recommend this company to anyone who wants to sell books or other media. I had an issue that they quickly handled for me and in a way that went beyond what they had to. Trust this company!\\nParts were reasonable price and one part missed component due to packing in warehouse. It came with missing component, but they credited the amount as it was very cheap under $10. Overall. I think it looks great and hope to review other part performance when mechanic places it. One thing I must want is the longer warranty on struts and shocks than a year, but that might be standard warranty time at other places too.\\nGood company with fast service and good customer service ethics.  The rates are too high though and could come down a bit.\\nI have been  happy to have loan with a company that treats there customs like family. I would go back to always money to got à other loan if I need one...\\nI appreciate how user friendly the site is. Im able to upload multiple resumes and cover letter.

The product is perfect.\\nIt was wonderful\\nSounded like they wanted to help, but ended up  just being a paid advertisement for a credit company.  I can get my scores for free.  I know my score and I know why it is where it is.  I am working on it, but in the mean time I need a vehicle.  I need a loan, not someone to explain my credit to me and charge me an auto pay of almost $40.00 month for it.\\nEverything went great. I was actually surprised at how lovely the diamonds were when they arrived.

Thanks please don\\'t get me wrong I love everything that Fabletics have.\\nVery easy, love that I could make reservations\\nLove the online tracking of the truck was able to get other things done while waiting thank you.\\nLoved our vacation experience! The owners of the house were so nice and helpful. We only had a short walk to the beach that we could easily take our beach stuff and kids. They had stuff we could use for the beach and an outside shower that was amazing! The residential beach made it so easy to keep up with my grandson. Can’t wait for next year! \\nThe Farley’s\\nWebsite was fine, but can\\'t give you an opinion on the product until we receive it :)\\nOrdered on Sunday got it Tuesday.\\nBest prices and great sales going on all around\\nI have had great success with using this online storage auction site. I do wish that there were more online auctions closer to my home. Maybe Storage Treasures will partner with more Santa Clarita storage unit businesses.\\nInstalled a couple days  a go shipping was fast great products would buy again\\nWe were upgraded to a BMW 320d. Very nice car indeed. Service at Sixt went well. Had to wait a little to pick up the car (as desk). Other than that, excellent service.\\nI have worked with Mary Eastman several times, and referred family members to her. I don’t know about other members of the company, but she is excellent at her job.\\nMe and my wife looked at all the other sites and this one had the best rates.\\nThey were excellent to work with. I initially ordered the wrong product on accident.  They fixed my order immediately.  I paid for expedited shipping and the product came faster than called for.  I would do business with them again in the future.\\nA week after I placed my first order with doggiefood, I called the company to follow-up on its status because it still was listed as \"processing.\" I was told they were out of the items I ordered.  But, they just got one the items in and would ship it the next day with an arrival day in four business days. I was told the other item should be in stock in a couple of days. Eight business days later I emailed the company to cancel my order because I had not received either product. Their reply was that the 1st product had shipped and would be here that Thursday. However, the other item was on back order and they would gladly refund me for it. Four hours later I received this email \"I had just went to have the orijen refunded and then was informed that they did in fact have the orijen sent out to you. I am very sorry for the confusion.\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWe eventual did receive the two items we purchased. However, the kibble was wrong. We ordered a 5lb. bag, but received 7 12oz small bags instead - not very convenient, but we were happy to have finally received our order. \\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral days later, I received a phone call from the company stating, \"as YOU know YOU received a double shipment of your order. We can send FedEx out to pick it up or we can charge your card if you want to keep it.\"  We did not receive a double order; and did not even receive our original order correctly. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many dog food companies out there. If you are looking for good customer service I would not choose doggiefood.\\nPatient, helpful and understanding\\nWe got our first vaporizer, and it has been working great. The whip came broken but with great customer serice Vapornation replaced it immediately. Very good experience will order again\\nZazzle is amazing!  My vendor screwed up and set the wrong time for my wedding so my invites were wrong and Zazzle jumped in and supported me and helped make it right immediately to help me at no extra cost.  The invites look amazing and perfect color and great paper quality.  They are quick and fast and are easy to reach.  I am amazed at how great of service I received and would definitely use them again and highly recommend them. Special Kudos to Lorraine who made it all happen.\\nThanks for quick shipping, great product and great service.\\ni try to choice justflu i was so happy with justfly always on the time\\nyou guys are just the worst website to do business with.  you guess telling me stories after i booked my mum flights.  you guys kept inflating the price from the original amount. i will never never buy my flight ticket on this website.\\nHaving only discovered Enchanting Travels via the internet, I was a little nervous that they would not deliver the service or experience I was expecting.  This fear was put to rest upon our arrival in India where expectations of safe, fun and informative travel were not only met but exceeded.  The guides provided in the different cities will vary in personality and the accommodation will vary is style, to which you may have a personal preference, but that is to be expected.  Considering the driving conditions in India, we thought our driver was legendary! We would definitely consider using Enchanting Travels again in other countries where we do not feel comfortable organising our own land transport (e.g. hire care or public transport) or think we may have issues with breaching the cultural or language divide.\\nHi,\\n\\nEven though, I had some tough time with 4Seating.com, I was fortunate to have called Mr. Fernando Reyes who was extremely helpful. He made sure, all my issues were resolved without giving me any hard time. What really surprised me is that he followed up with me to re-confirm that i no longer had any other issues.  , He understood my frustration and made sure they all are resolved.  I am very pleased with dealing with him and I would surely recommend his name to other customers especially if they had any issues... Fernando Reyes deserves the 5 star I rate.\\nExcellent service!\\nNice selection and wonderful gift to receive.  Would definitely use again!\\nVery dirty business and dirty drivers. Dishonest and should be banned for ever.\\n\\nAbusive drivers and cheats directions by taken longer distance to your destination.\\n\\nRates fracture and change every second and minutes.\\n\\nIt is like stock exchange.\\n\\nCheating, and dishonest.\\nCalled several days before departure date & spoke to Leslie to request pick up @ 11 am on 3/30/18 instead of noon.  Was told that wouldn\\'t be a problem -  van wasn\\'t ready.  We had to wait for it to be cleaned. The guy cleaning the van was clearly upset and complaining about being asked to clean it!  You could hear everything he was yelling about as he threw things in the back room, while complaining Leslie had asked him to clean it. Needless to say, the van was not cleaned to our expectations (carpet not vacuumed, and outside a mess).  For a 2018 GMC the van was a terrible ride!!  Not near enough cup holders for a 12 seater, and it had so many rattles the trip was miserable.  Some customer service training might be beneficial for AVR as Leslie was short and rude with a room full of customers waiting.  Will not rent from AVR again.  Over priced for what we got.  Would not recommend at all.  Will drive two vehicles next time.  TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE from pick up to drop off!  Can I get a REFUND?  No recommendation from me.\\nEverything was exactly right.\\nsome very attractive games recently, but I like to get theme with soundtracks!!!\\nNo results at all\\nMy order shipped the next day and I love what I purchased!\\nMy room was 231.  Right after my Mom & I got settled in, I climbed in the bed closest to the window.  I immediately hear a cell phone vibrating to the left of me. Both of our phones were on the night stand between us, so I started looking for this phone I thought may have been left by a previous person. Looked under the curtains, edge of the bed and between the mattress....nothing.  A bit later, Mom says, \"No, I\\'m fine.\" I ask her what she is talking about. She says, \"You asked me if I was warm enough.\"  Oh no I didn\\'t! I hadn\\'t said anything at all.  During the night (about 3 am) I wake up to see a dark shadow at the end of my Mom\\'s bed. It disappeared quickly. Then to top if off, later I wake up to pressure on my bed, like someone had sat on it!! This happened about 4 times!  I\\'ve never experienced that type of thing before, so I was a bit unnerved by it!  I\\'m wondering if the remodeling a few doors down stirred something up?\\nMy package is still sitting in the post office.  We must have a substitute carrier because our regular carrier brings packages and puts them in the garage!\\nBEST EVER AND NOTHING GETS DELETED!\\nI would like to thank Shun for his great help!!\\nlove to use trip advisor as one of my guides to go to for info.\\nI enjoyed the online experience of ordering directly from Dior.  I especially enjoyed being able to sample other products that are often not offered in the Department Stores.\\nTheir price for Blue dog food is comparable to Petsmart. Instead of driving to Petsmart to buy a heavy bag of dog food, I now order from Petflow and orders over $49 have free shipping. With Petflow, it still costs about $1.00 more than if I were to go to Petsmart, however, I don\\'t think there is any tax AND I don\\'t have to pay for gas to get there. I think it evens out in the end, or quite possibly, it is cheaper to order from Petflow! Thanks, Petflow!\\nIt is great to get reviews of businesses from those who have used them but your automated system almost pesters us users to death with the constant emails to rate this or that. It appears the just viewing the phone number of a vendor is enough to trigger the \"tidy up\" automated process and it will not stop until you have told the computer that either you did not use this vendor or give that vendor a rating. I use Angie\\'s LIst to save time but seem to spend some of my precious time responding to your computerized emails to rate a vendor I never used. Annoying. Other than that, a great service.\\nI went to the store to purchase 4 items. Store did not have all 4. They were great and helped me order all 4  items on their website. 1 of the 4 items arrived 5 days later. 2 of the items showed up today. 1 item was found at their warehouse, after we called to find out where 4th item is. Very poor inventory management as well as poor follow up customer service.\\nVery  good costumer service and all above\\nI needed a logo at the last minute for a trade show I was attending and did not have the time to wait to use an in town logo service like I had in the past. I was beyond pleased with the logo that was created for me. And was suprised when I downloaded my logo to find that I had numerous versions of the logo to use. It made it very easy to send my logo off to the trade show for their website and ittook me seconds to add it to my website and  marketing material. I will defiantly recommend this site to a friend.\\nI didn’t think drivers ed could be fun until I learned from ace thanks for the information and tips. I recommend this to anyone trying to get behind the wheel !\\nOrdered a three-item living room set including a reclining sofa, reclining loveseat and reclining chair.  All items matched perfectly in new, outstanding condition.  Coleman Furniture kept in contact with us on the status throughout the entire process. Ordered Nov 16th and had the items placed in our house by the delivery company on Dec 18th.  This was good timing knowing the factory had to make the order, ship it to the delivery company and they had to coordinate delivery with us. We\\'ve had items broken or damaged during 11 military moves, but everything was great on this transaction with Coleman Furniture.  So glad we decided to order with them and we saved over $1,150!\\nI have been very pleased with Thrift Books and they are timely in getting the books to me.  The price is fair and the books have so far been in good to excellent condition.\\nFriendly helpful shuttle drivers.  Very convenient and economical!\\nNeeded quotes for photo booth for my wedding reception 2 weeks before.

Most of the orders were shipped on the same day as they mentioned.  Only one time they delayed my order for a few days.  I can say I\\'m happy with my shopping with PureFormulas.\\nAlways professional, courteous and never any issues.  No hard sell to purchase insurance products, the vehicles are always as requested.   Really nice people at the Jacksonville airport location.\\nMy alpaca mug shipped quickly and received in one piece.  This is my favorite coffee mug!\\nAfter booking a last minute trip tonAtuna, I realized my passport was expired. Googled rushmy passport, followed the directions and within 10 days I had my new passport. I didn\\'t have to even think twice about the process, the application and didn\\'t wait in a single line. Easiest thing I did all year... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\\nI came in at around 558pm when the store closed at 6pm. Expecting to be turned down and to hear heavy sighs upon my arrival, I just wanted to see what was wrong with my tire on my drivers side of my Infiniti for my safety. Upon entering, I was immediately greeted by Sergio and treated as if I was his first customer of the day -- when I was definitely his last so close to closing. This is a huge deal for me being a general manager of a company myself. Joe also stayed passed his shift, to help me and ensure I was completely satisfied. I had previously negative experiences with Al Horan at this location, and I stayed away, but because of Sergio and Joe I will go out of my way to now go back to this town fair tire. Thank you for your exceptional service, and you now have a customer for life.\\nHomeadvisor led me to a great contractor.

She went out of her way to make sure I was taken care of.  I would highly recommend DXL to any of my friends or family.\\nI have only been able to make contact on the phone twice with TJ. Multiple emails and multiple calls from my father in law occurred before they made contact with TJ. After all of that, my father in law received the wrong part. Again, when my father in law tried to contact TJ to arrange for the return of the wrong part he was unsuccessful on several attempts to make contact with TJ. They are currently waiting for an actual reply other than the automated email response. Your communication process is terribly lacking and needs to be remedied if you want to continue to be successful. I found Parts Geek for my father in law since he was having a hard time finding his part and your site showed you had them in stock. His truck is still inoperable and I feel like I let him down by putting him in contact with you. I hope you can resolve his issues quickly, especially since TJ sent the wrong part in the first place.\\ntook them awhile but they did the right thing and paid via paypal. thanks!\\nI got good deal .\\nLove buying books from Thrift Books.

Just fly gave me plenty of options and confirmed my flights in just minutes.\\nProduct arrived quickly and was of good quality.  Quick installation too!\\nI like Videoblocks because for a low annual fee I can get good videos. I have not had the service too long, but in the time I have been a member, I have found some good videos for my social media posts. It\\'s also good to know that if I find a video I like that is not in the free/members section, it won\\'t cost me an arm and a leg to purchase.\\nI have an account that we use specifically for our high school class reunion expenses.  I had checks made with our school mascot and logo on them and they are perfect!\\nOnly positive surprises with this purchase. Packaging surpassed my expectations! (Foundation formula could have been better... a bit drying / texture enhancing and would have been better sans fragrance; but I expected this due to reviews read prior, and the olive shade range was absolutely perfect) \\n\\nThey did miss an opportunity to send more samples...  I probably would have been tempted to make further purchases given the chance to sample other products (especially mascara and/or lip products that can\\'t be sampled hygienically in store). \\n\\nOverall it was positive online shopping experience, definitely wouldn\\'t hesitate to buy from again or recommend to a friend.\\nI\\'ve purchased a couple of watches from Jomashop. Both instances featured FAST shipping (as in receiving the products within 2 days), well packaged products, with expected touchpoints (email receipts, when it shipped, tracking, etc).

We were a family of 8 adults and 3 children.  We all got the bikes we wanted, including my 7-year old grandson.  For our two 5-year old grandchildren who didn\\'t know how to bike yet, a trailer was attached to one of the adult bikes and they too enjoyed the tour.  Our tour guide, Kirstie, was fantastic!  She had a lovely Scottish lilt and made the history of Paris come alive!  It felt like she was just relating a story that happened yesterday.  I learned so much more about  Paris, French history, they way Paris as a city was planned than I ever had during past trips.  And biking around made us feel like local Parisians.  Kirstie took good care in guiding us safely through the busy streets of Paris.  Everyone in my family thinks that the Bike tour was the best!\\nFree shipping???? Seriously? Yes!! I couldn\\'t believe it! Absolutely free shipping on a relatively inexpensive purchase. I was delighted to say the least. The entire transaction was top notch. Quick delivery!

Thanks Freedom Debt Relief!\\nTheir representative would only allow me to send my broken phone into them first to see if they could repair it  then return the phone back to me.  That would have left me with no phone communication for a week or so.  I called back the next day  & had another rep fix the problem after a relatively lengthy phone call .  I then asked to speak to a manager & was told that person would call me.  It\\'s been 10 days , or so , a manager has still not called.  I would never use Square Trade again & would NOT recommend them to my family or friends.\\nI recently ordered snow shoes and I am happy to say that the order was delivered on time with no issues.  The quality of the service is superb.\\nFiling my divorce using MyDivorcePapers.com was easy and very convenient. The interview process was thorough and easy to understand. The entire process makes sure to cover every area of my divorce so nothing was missed.\\nI can\\'t say enough about Smilebox! I have been with them for a very long time and can always count on sending a message that is unique and, depending of the occasion find a card that perfectly salutes the occasion. I also find it a fun thing to do and an excellent way to use your creative energies! I can honestly say there has never been an occasion when I was crunched for time that Smilebox didn\\'t come through with just the perfect solution and I was saved the embarrassment of not having an appropriate, thoughtful card to send to a friend, colleague or family member. Kudos Smilebox!\\nDuGood is the greatest!\\nThe cost of the travel was great but the service provided was very inadequate. It took us a long time before receiving our itenary after booking.

They responded with confirmation of the bullnose I needed, the quantity, and shipping options.\\nEmail updates and final shipping notice was spot on.

Amazing savings.\\nfast & easy process.\\nWould recommend to others\\nI ordered flowers for my best friend. She lives out of state and was having surgery and i couldn\\'t be there.

And, then I got the reds. But, honestly, I don\\'t care how many points (they were all rated in 90\\'s) the wine gets, some were just not easy to drink. So, I added diet Sprite. Do you really want that to happen? The best thing about your service is the free shipping to my address. Other than that, no so much!\\nI was transferred to a reservation specialist from the front desk person. The agent and I could not hear or understand each other, so I hung up and made my reservation online. It was very easy to use the online service. My stay at the hotel is tomorrow, so we will see how that goes.\\nThis is/was a dreadful experience.

I live in a city too.\\nThe only issues I have is when buying from 3rd party. I go through the process of buying a book. Pay for it and all that. Then I get a notification that the order has been cancelled. That\\'s a little aggravating. One time I believe I ordered a book from Textbook Rush, the book was a Instructors Edition or International, I can\\'t remember. The book was taped up to hide it. I returned the book for a refund with no issues, but it was a inconvenience. Other than that I think I\\'m pretty pleased with my experience with Textbook Rush.\\nIt was the best experience I have ever had!!!! Could not have been more pleased. Definitely will use them again.

We saved money and avoided some long line-ups which made our trip so much better.  We also took advantage of the Hop-On Hop-Off bus offer when we ordered our Passes and would definitely recommend it as well.  Paying the extra for shipping and getting the guide books early was a big help in planning our trip.\\r\\nI would recommend the New York Pass to anybody wanting to see all the sights!\\nHighly recommend public storage the area is always clean good security and outstanding customer service I highly recommend this place for your personal belongings.\\nHouzz, and its associates of builders, architects, and decorators allows us to think beyond our imaginations so that we can live the dream of living in our dream homes.\\nExcellent car rental in service and worth of money.

It\\'s the  worse company that I ever seem.  I suppose to receive a package today, and I was waiting the whole day and tracking the package when the person that supposed to bring it writes that they came and no one was here.  That was not true, I didn\\'t leave the house a second, I was with my phone the whole day.  They didn\\'t left any paper saying that they came,but  they write down that they came in the tracking information. I call twice and nobody seems to care about it. And the only answer was that I have to wait until the next day,  and they will deliver to a access point,  no even in my address.\\nMy customer service experience with Autolenders has been consistently good. No pressure but very pleasant to deal with\\nMy husband called the customer service line prior to ordering to see how long it would take for the glasses to arrive.

There aren\\'t any live contact persons available. Poor customer service. Address not recognized to schedule via phone.\\nQuick, professional, and thorough. I would happily recommend HelloMD and Dr. Sridaran.\\nExcellent tickets\\nQuickly found three pros in area for my project. What I didn\\'t realize was that asking for estimate meant the three would call immediately. I contracted with the first call as his quote was below the average estimates you posted. When other two called I found out that companies must pay for the calls they make with estimates. Next time  will know to wait and hear from all possible pros in area.\\nOverall extremely pleased with my first encounter with HAdvisor\\nVery unhappy with this rental start to finish. I voiced my concerns when I dropped the car off but nothing was done.

It made our stay in Santa Fe even more delightful.\\nHaving trouble making it up some of these hills in western PA. I would gladly give speed for a little more power. Disappointing\\nI got a free trial of Alpha Brain from Onnit, and I can honestly notice a difference in my ability to focus clearly and calmly on tasks without any jitters.  I also noticed it was easier to formulate opinions when having conversations with people.  Ideas flow better, and past memory\\'s seem to be more easily accessible.  I highly recommend Alpha Brain, and I praise Onnit for there promise to use only earth grown Ingredients instead of man made chemicals.  It\\'s a little expensive, but worth it.  I\\'ll be getting it on the regular for sure.\\nEasy ordering and fast shipping and delivery\\nOrdered before and their shipping time frame has steadily increased.  This time they \"lost\" the order and we had to call and find out where it was.

Easy to assemble.\\nGreat fast and good parts\\nBought the CityPass for New York. Honestly it was the best deal you could find. Able to see all the big name attraction and tour spots for a low price is what made me buy it. New York is a big city, I\\'m from Colorado and it was definitely different. CityPass helped simplify the trip and I had more time to enjoy everything. I\\'ve already recommended to all my friends. I\\'d use it again for the other cities available for sure\\nProducts themselves were very good and what I ordered. However, I paid extra for shipping to arrive in 3 days for a special event but it arrived a week and a half later instead. When I reached out to get reimbursed for cost difference of premium shipping to standard, Cafe press customer service offered to reimburse the whole cost for my trouble. I was delighted but of course its been a week now since that offer was given and I haven\\'t actually been reimbursed for anything. Just suckered into paying for a service I didn\\'t receive. We\\'ve ordered before without issues (never for expedited shipping though), I just think if an order can\\'t be done by the time paid for then the customer shouldn\\'t be allowed to pay the higher cost.\\nalways have what I am looking for at the best price with free shipping. can\\'t beat it!\\nWorked great and easy to use!  Wish I would have had it sooner!!\\nMy experience with this storage was wonderful the staff was very nice the storage area was very clean all in all if i had to get another storage place this will be the place i will return too\\nOne of the gifts I ordered did not arrive until December 27, even though I had called and been told all four orders would be delivered before Christmas.

We also received the bracelets in record time.Thanks a million!\\nConvenient, fast and professional.\\nYour prices are competitive and your checks come promptly. :)\\nFirst, they misrepresented a color of an item on their Website, so I had to exchange it.  Second, when I called they promised that if I exchange, I will not be charged any additional shipping.  Third, I did a return and they charged me $7 for shipping.  Fourth, I cannot get to Customer service re this issue because they are \"too busy\" and they would not connect me to it.  Horrible! Is this a service that we expect from an Internet business?\\nHad a minor issue, was contacted immediately by a representative to took care of the issue.  Very happy with end result.\\nI had been fretting buying the right ring for a while. I wanted something that both my fiancé and myself were proud of. I looked at some stores in Chicago, and shopped a bit online and To be honest I was kind of dissappointed with what my money could get me.  Then I found Jennifer at Brilliance.  I told her how much I was willing to spend and that I want to go as big as possible while still being beautiful to the eye. I was so indecisive because she got me multiple list each week of options that were all amazing and all UNDER my price point. That is a rarity in the jewelry business. She wasn\\'t pushy and she was soooooo patient. When I finally bought the ring she was in constant contact with me and assured me it would deliver in time. When the ring showed up I was blown away. I still catch my fiancé looking down at the ring and smiling. You would be foolish to go anywhere else. \\r\\n\\r\\nThank you brilliance for making me look like a hero. \\r\\n\\r\\nDavid\\neasy and affordable\\nDid what it said on the tin –\\xa0the site was easy to use, and the car I booked was waiting for me when I arrived.\\na lot more choices for plus size online\\nCareful how,u order,pay attention to the amount u need,I have to many boxes\\nThrift Books is always the # 1 site I go to for books, and has been for some time.

Was a pleasure to chat with her and helped with my shipping situation and concerns and gave me a refund for the delay. They didn’t have to do that since it still is in transit and coming Monday or so..but they definitely wanted to go over and beyond for me.

I look forward to working with her in the near future, as I plan to purchase more gold and silver to enhance my retirement portfolio.\\nI am highly upset and frustrated at this point. I called square trade to get repairs done to my Iphone 7 that i purchased of purchasing power on Sept 8, 2017... the person who assisted me with my claim was very polite and helpful. He filed my claim and sent me the shipping label and told me it would be better if i sent my phone in on Monday so that i can have my phone by Wednesday per the overnight shipping that he stated was so easy and convenient.  The shipping instructions was plain and simple and i followed them and mailed my phone off on Sept 11th. I received and email stating that my phone was shipped and that it was received on Tues Sept 11 @1000am. So going off the gentleman i spoke to i figured my phone will be fixed that day and shipped to me that night to be received on Wednesday. I didn\\'t receive and update and so i contacted square trade for an update. The gentleman stated that yes the phone is in the process of repairs and i should receive my phone on Thursday. i was ok with a day delay. Thursday comes and i still have not receive an update on the phone. Friday comes and i contact again. The young lady states that an email was sent to me to turn of find my iphone and that I need to respond to email in order to start repairs. By now i am livid because none of this was communicated to me and from my understanding and the last conversation i had was that my phone was getting repaired. In the instructions before sending i should have been instructed to turn off find my iphone before shipping but i wasn\\'t. And also each time i mad contact i shouldn\\'t have been told different instructions and updates. Its is now Monday and contact them again in regards to my claim, the teller states that they received the confirmation in regards to my phone and will start repairs today and i will receive a confirmation withing 24/48hours. What was supposed to be a 2-3 day thing turned into a whole week. I am a mother with two young children and to be without a phone for a week is ridiculous especially when most companies don\\'t give out loaner phones which in my case my service doesn\\'t. I pay for the coverage so that this kind of thing doesn\\'t happen and i thought i was going to be guaranteed that my phone would be back 2-3 days flat. The tellers were all telling me different things and now i have to wait and extra maybe 24 to 48 hours to get an update and maybe another few days before i actually get my phone sent back to me fixed. A full 8 days and my phone isn\\'t repaired and sent back to me. I am highly upset and i will never do this again nor refer  anybody to use squaretrade.!!!\\nI received my shipment on time, however I ordered a size 12 -18 month baby onesie and received a 18 - 24 month instead, which is *much* too big. As I was hoping to use it for a specific occasion, I did not have time to reorder the proper size in time, which left me scrambling to find something else.\\nI have decided not to return the item, as it will fit down the road, and I am satisfied with the quality etc otherwise.\\nLeagueApps has been a great partner from day one for us.  We are a large travel baseball organization and we love how they have streamlined our registration process and created our website for our families.  What makes them standout from all the others is that they continue to develop products that we have discussed that would help our organization.  Their customer service is TOP NOTCH -  We all joke in our organization that JAKE from LeagueApps is my super hero!!!  We have continued to grow our company with their software and support\\nVery nice pricing and stay\\nGreat product and service\\nThis is cooking great food at its easiest. The ingredients are top notch and the directions are very easy to follow. One of my favorite things is on the recipe cards. The exact quantities needed for each ingredient so you can replicate it at a later date.\\nQuality company!\\nfirstly money got deducted from my account and order was not placed. the lenskart agent was at my home to do the check up and he helped me to place the order and later on he said that it has gone through and i will get my specs in 2-3 days. But on logging to the site I see that it has been cancelled and refunded as a credit point which i did not wanted. Everything was done without my knowledge. This is really not expected.  I will never try for lenskart anymore. worst service. Now I need to wait 7-10 days to get my money back. this is not at all acceptable\\nRemitly is the fastest secured way of sending remittances.  Not to mention higher conversion rates and lowest service fee.

For some reason they couldnt find my order number but I had a copy on me and all is well.\\nI\\'m so glad you asked.  I was looking at a product.  A banner exclaimed, \\'FREE SHIPPING!\\'.   I made a purchase for an inexpensive ($12) item.I accepted the terms. I completed the sale. I was charged $8 for shipping. When I called CS to straighten this out I was informed that the free shipping was a separate company. At the \\'shipping company\\'   i would have to join & get a \\'credit for the shipping that you charged. \\nOk, you got me. You fooled me. I mistakenly thought that I could trust you, your site, your products, this transaction. Ha ha, you fooled me.... once.\\nIt goes without saying, but I\\'ll say it anyway. I will never give you another dollar of my hard earned money.\\nThey gave me the information I needed to make a decision and take Cisco classes\\nThe mini birthday chocolate cupcakes were not only pretty to look at but delicious.

So far they are on schedule and in fact overachieving.  Their internal systems do need some work; the triage telephone system sometimes goes into a loop, documents need to be sent several times before they are properly processed and I even received information about another client once in error.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAll of the people I have interacted with at Pioneer are always professional and courteous, but many times they are not knowledgeable about my situation and therefore spend time reviewing my file while in a telephone conversation.  It also seems that the clients files are not always up to date and do not reflect recent activity.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary my experiences are positive and if the current path continues the results will be outstanding so dealing with some systems issues will not seem to be material if the end goal is over achieved.\\nI would highly recommend Comedy Driving to all customers it is funny and very educational.\\nIt was an excellent experience shopping with this company. My friend was hurry to get a Hamilton watch in 4 days and he was leaving the country. Bobby helped me to get one and ship it to me by the overnight shipping. We got the watch at the very last minute and the watch is brand new in a great shape. Will definitely recommend this company to my friends.\\nThe booking process was easy, the owner quickly responded to the first request and several questions after.  The entire trip was great.\\nEasy to order online, same as in store.\\nFound a unique item I needed and arrived on time.\\nThis company is garbage. They shipped me the wrong part and did nothing to make it right. I was told they could not ship me the correct part, I was told to ship back the incorrect part and after they received it they would cancel my active order and then take 5 days to give me my money back so I could finally reorder and keep my fingers crossed that this time the idiots would ship the correct part. I informed them that I lost 100 dollars because the dealer charged me for taking apart my car only to discover I had showed up with the wrong part and they simply did not care and never offered to help. This company does not deserve my business and this will be the last time I buy anything from them. I hope this review saves another person from having to go through this experience. Ps Jennifer Rowebott is the moron that refused to help me, the last thing she said was a manager would contact me and here I am 3 days later and I still have not heard from anyone.\\n\\nGarbage company with Garbage staff!!!!!\\nI booked a car through VIP Cars and paid a deposit. After a couple of days I recieved a feedback from the rental company that the pre-booked and paid car was not available. I accepted this and asked them to pay back my deposit.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I booked another car through VIP cars and got one confirmed without the need for deposit or pre-pay. When I arrived the desitnation, and I brought with me the confirmation letter from both VIP cars and the rental company, I was told that they didn\\'t have any cars available.\\r\\n\\r\\nI ended up booking a new car from a local rental company, and I had to pay more for sure being there in need of a car, staying there with a family of 5 with a 4 hours drive to our final desination.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen I started the fight to get my deposit paid back from the first car, a lot of email to and from VIP Cars, and it took more than 2 month before I got the deposit back.\\r\\n\\r\\nConclusion: the worst car rental experience ever :(\\nthis is my first time to buy a insight eye-glass online.

True to size, material is really comfortable and made well,and of course the shipping was fast!\\nWhen I was not able to fly as I had planned, I began the process to file a claim.  This was easy only because I elected to use paper and pencil, not being computer literate enough to do it on-line.

I have already recommended your site to other managers in my region.\\nThe lady who took my reservation was extremely nice and helpful.\\nLooking for a quick service avaliable for my iPhone 5C, I needed something to clear up some unlocking requests so the phone could be used internationally for family use. The issue was the phone was bought by a 3rd party and when unlocking, it would return an unable to unlock due to unpaid history. This was annoying since I really needed the phone to work and ended up using the service. At first, they charged $17 USA to run a semi unlock. Within a week, they emailed back saying I needed a premium unlock which costed an additional $63 USA. The total was about $80 to unlock but after a total amount of 20 whole days from start date to end with unlock email, it was successful. Took a while considering the time frame was said to be 3-15 days but better late then never. Thank you for the good service!\\nBought Mafia III after it was bought it said Europe only, got my money back but had to buy Steam cards to get almost 66 dollars CDN out. Staff was rude as well.

Nowhere was this clear on the website until you have paid and it is too late\\nBought for my wife for Christmas. She is delighted.

I have had many jobs call me or email me inviting me to do an interview with them. Thank you so very much.I also like that CareerBuilder shows me who has looked at my resume.\\nI needed a transmission filter kit for my truck.  I typed in the requested information regarding my vehicle, ie; year, make, model etc., and the PartsGeek website indicated which AC Delco parts kit I needed.  I ordered the part and paid about $40.00 including shipping, and received the kit promptly.  The part was not the correct part for my vehicle.  PartsGeek is willing to refund my money upon me returning the filter kit.  It will cost me $14.95 to ship the kit back. The problem is the PartsGeek website is flawed and not detailed enough to make sure customers are ordering the correct parts.  I own four vehicles and do all my maintenance myself.  I order all the time from Rock Auto, Summit and A1 Auto.  Never had a problem with them.  Not sure I\\'ll give PartsGeek another chance.\\nI love this belt, easily adjustable and comfortable.\\nThe girls are always so nice and happy.\\nI always use WallyPark and their service is good, especially the drivers and parking staff.

The part shipped on 6/19 they charged m $9.95 for shipping. Sadly as a moved through the ordering process they offered no estimated arrival date. I recieved the tracking number and FedEx expects to deliver on 6/30. Who waits two weeks for an a/c part in the middle of summer. Never again! PartsGeek needs a better shipping partner.\\nJust got our Christmas cards for about the 12th year and you\\'ll never find a better selection at such WONDERFUL PRICES.  Great quality and very fast service.  We\\'ve been shopping at Walter Drake for years and they\\'re consistently \"steady\".

The whole process was so comfortable that I lost track of time as I was using the Virtual Movie Glasses.  University Oak Dental is the Best in Town. I recommend that you come to University Oaks Dental. You will Love it.\\nVince was awesome in guiding us through our process and answering all of our questions.  Great experience!\\nI had a number of problems with the website.  There was no mention of the $25.00 charge for selecting a seat - then I was unable to void the seat selection.  Also, the website is too slow - by the time a person is able to complete all of the information and make the choices, the seat(s) were sold out.  Not a good experience.  However, I spoke to Cedric in customer service and that was excellent.  He was able to take care of the transaction quickly.  He was friendly, efficient and professional.  Good Job!\\nordered on wednesday arrived friday from usa exactly as described, but the carrier UPS conned me out of 22.16  pence they said was customs charges but was their dishonest extraction of extra payment from me.

I like the different questions asked to get my view.\\nI put a car on reserve for $200.  Returned with an additional $1,000 when the required down payment was only $800.  Asked for my $200 cash back that I used to reserve and was told no I could not get that money back unless I wanted to start the process all over.
